Therefore, understanding how to induce mucosal immune responses in piglets is essential in the mechanism and application against PEDV infection with mucosal immunity. A method of treatment in our research was used to make an oral vaccine that packaged the inactive PEDV with microencapsulation, which consisted of sodium alginate and chitosan, and adapted the condition of the gut in mice. The in vitro release experiment of microcapsules showed that inactive PEDV was not only easily released in saline and acid solutions but also had an excellent storage tolerance, and was suitable for use as an oral vaccine. Interestingly, both experimental groups with different doses of inactive virus enhanced the secretion of specific antibodies in the serum and intestinal mucus, which caused the effective neutralization against PEDV in the Vero cell by both IgG and IgA, respectively. Moreover, the microencapsulation could stimulate the differentiation of CD11b+ and CD11c+ dendritic cells, which means that the microencapsulation was also identified as an oral adjuvant to help phagocytosis of dendritic cells in mice. Flow cytometry revealed that the B220<sup>+</sup> and CD23<sup>+</sup> of the B cells could significantly increase antibody production with the stimulation from the antigens&#x02019; PEDV groups, and the microencapsulation could also increase the cell viability of B cells, stimulating the secretion of antibodies such as IgG and IgA in mice. In addition, the microencapsulation promoted the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2;. Moreover, proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-17, were inhibited by alginate and chitosan in the microencapsulation groups compared with the inactivated PEDV group. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the microparticle could play the role of mucosal adjuvant, and release inactivated PEDV in the gut, which can effectively stimulate mucosal and systemic immune responses in mice.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>microcapsules</kwd><kwd>PEDV</kwd><kwd>mucosal immunity</kwd><kwd>alginate</kwd><kwd>chitosan</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>National Natural Science Foundation of China</funding-source><award-id>31902169</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Heilongjiang Province Science Fund for Excellent Young Scholars</funding-source><award-id>YQ2020C008</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Young Talents&#x0201d; Project of Northeast Agricultural University</funding-source><award-id>18QC39</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant number:31902169), the Heilongjiang Province Science Fund for Excellent Young Scholars (Grant number: YQ2020C008), Young Talents&#x0201d; Project of Northeast Agricultural University (Grant number: 18QC39.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-animals-13-00889"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, PEDV, is a highly contagious disease that infects the small intestinal epithelial cells of piglets during the first seven days of birth, and the mortality rate can range from 70% to 100% in three-day-old piglets [<xref rid="B1-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. At the first week of birth, the major immune protection of piglets is dependent on maternal antibodies and innate immunity. The maternal antibody is induced by the inactivated and attenuated vaccines of PEDV through the intramuscular route or subcutaneous injection in the pregnant sow, but the maternal antibody is digested by gastric acid and pepsin before entering the intestine, which cannot effectively protect against PEDV infection. However, mucosal immunity can be built no more than three days after birth, and provides more effective protection than systemic immunity in piglets. Some studies have demonstrated that the first line of defense by IgA in the intestine would be more effective than that by IgG for neutralizing the infection of intestinal diseases [<xref rid="B2-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, the problem of how to transport the inactivated PEDV virus into the intestine and activate mucosal immunity has not yet been solved. Moreover, the mechanism of mucosal immunity to PEDV in the gut of fetal pigs remains unclear. The process of specialized M-cells taking up and presenting PEDV to the dendritic cells and lymphoid follicles also needs to be better understood to learn how antigens arrive at the inductive sites for T-cell- and B-cell-dependent activation of IgG and IgA production. One interesting strategy is packaging vaccines to look like microcapsules, which have different properties for oral immunity, such as size, shape, and surface molecule organization [<xref rid="B3-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Chitosan and alginate are mixed to coagulate the ionic gel, which is a potential candidate vehicle for their main constituents due to their intrinsic immunomodulatory properties. Alginate is one of the most widely used carriers for the controlled release of different types of active agents. Moreover, sodium alginate, which is derived from marine brown algae and bacteria, has received attention as an antimicrobial in the food industry because of its unique physicochemical properties and biological activity. Chitosan (CS), also called poly glucosamine, is widely used to enhance the mucosal immune response due to its biocompatibility, biodegradability, and mucoadhesive properties [<xref rid="B4-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The production method of alginate&#x02013;chitosan microcapsules by using ionic gelation is an interesting approach to compound oral delivery systems for inactivated PEDV vaccines. The classic technique involves first mixing the antigen of inactivated PEDV and alginate solution and then pouring it slowly into a solution of calcium chloride and chitosan. Finally, the alginate microcapsules are collected by decanting the supernatant and are washed with water. Hence, the preparation method of PEDV alginate microcapsules is very simple. The manufacture of microencapsulations showed that they used simple machinery, had a low cost, and a good safety profile, making them an attractive approach to oral immunization. In a previous study of the mucosal immune system, oral vaccination with recombinant Lactobacillus was more promising for stimulating specific immunization against pathogens in the first contact with mucosal surfaces [<xref rid="B5-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. To improve the effectiveness of the oral vaccination delivery method, which protects against PEDV infection, avoiding digestive degradation in the acidic environment of the stomach is crucial (oral vaccination with alginate microsphere systems). There is also a novel microencapsulation method for rotavirus with anionic polymers and amines, including sodium alginate and spermine hydrochloride, which increases the antibody titers against rotavirus infection [<xref rid="B8-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Similarly, microencapsulations of PEDV can arrive at the gut of piglets and release the virus in an alkaline environment. Moreover, they can be taken up by mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues to activate mucosal immune responses against encapsulated PEDV, and be processed by Peyer&#x02019;s patches and M-cells in the small intestine [<xref rid="B9-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>In this study, inactivated PEDV packaged in microencapsulations was used to explore an efficient oral vaccine delivery system to release the virus into the gut, which would be better for protecting against PEDV-induced specific mucosal immunity in mice. In addition, mucosal and systemic immune responses were monitored for specific antibodies, such as IgA and IgG, in the feces and serum of mice, and then used to analyze the neutralizing activity against PEDV. Most importantly, the micro-encapsulations of PEDV were used with the antigen of complete enterovirus particles to present into the mucosal immune cells in the gut. The functional immune cells in the specific immune response, such as dendritic cells and B cells, were studied to focus on the mechanism of complete virus particles in the recognition, presentation, and antigen processing with oral mucosal immunity against enterovirus infection in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-animals-13-00889"><title>2.

A PEDV strain (LJB/03) was isolated and stored in our laboratory. Confluent Vero cells grown in a 5 mL tissue culture flask were washed with PBS three times and inoculated with 1 mL of a mixture solution containing trypsin at a concentration of 10 &#x000b5;g/mL, PEDV inoculation culture (3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> PFU), and DMEM without any serum. After incubating at 37 &#x000b0;C for 1 h, 4 mL of DMEM with trypsin at a concentration of 8 &#x000b5;g/mL was added. Before 70% cytopathic effects, the cells were maintained at 37 &#x000b0;C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and monitored daily. Finally, the diseased cells were subjected to three rounds of freezing and thawing, and then the supernatants were collected after centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 rpm. The virus titers were measured with the method of TCID50, and the PEDV titer was approximately 6.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> PFU. PEDV was inactivated with 0.1 M binary ethylenimine (BEI) to a final volume of 5%, which was incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C for 24 h. In addition, sodium thiosulfate was used to neutralize the excess BEI at 37 &#x000b0;C for 2 h.

The trend of the in vitro release ability of microcapsules in the PBS group and normal saline group was similar, and the release rate was more than 50% on the 3rd day; on the 18<sup>th</sup> day, the release rate reached 95% and 91%, respectively. However, that of the hydrochloric acid group was only 37.5% on the 3rd day and just 63.2% on the 18th day. These results indicated that the microcapsules were easily released in saline solution, but most importantly, they were acid-stable. The release ability after different months of storage showed that the release rate remained higher than 83% in the first three months, and they still maintained the lowest release rate of 41% in the fifteenth month.

The 50% neutralization with IgG of the high PEDV group was probably 1:256, while the PEDV (low) microcapsule group was 1:128. The 50% neutralization of the PEDV (high) microcapsule group was higher than the PEDV (low) microcapsule group in the neutralization. The neutralization of IgA in both the PEDV (high) and PEDV (low) microcapsule groups was higher than that in the inactivated PEDV group, inhibiting PEDV infection in the in vitro experiment.

The neutralization ability of IgG and IgA in the PEDV (high) microcapsule group was higher than that in the PEDV (low) microcapsule group.

Discussion</title><p>The PEDV outbreak of 2013&#x02013;2014 led to annual losses among worldwide swine producers. The loss of productivity from enteric diseases of PEDV in neonatal piglets costs swine producers millions of dollars [<xref rid="B2-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B22-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Previous development of live and attenuated vaccines for another diarrheal virus of pigs, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), provided insights into the mechanisms of mucosal immunity with IgA and piglet protection [<xref rid="B5-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B23-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A previous study showed that the inactive PEDV was effective in stimulating the specific antibody of IgA in an immunized sow with attenuated vaccines protecting the piglets for lactogenic immunity [<xref rid="B24-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Lactogenic immunity from pregnant sows is induced via the gut&#x02013;mammary gland secretory IgA (sIgA) axis, which is also a promising and effective way to protect suckling piglets from PEDV infection [<xref rid="B25-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, a successful PEDV vaccine must induce sufficient maternal or self-reproductive IgA antibodies [<xref rid="B26-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, the PEDV did not use the same route as the TGEV immune plan. The main reason is that the antibody titers of PEDV did not reach the titers of TGEV to boost a successful immune response. More research has focused on recombinant vaccines with different delivery vectors to protect antigens not digested by gastric acid [<xref rid="B28-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, the exposure dose of antigen was too low to stimulate specific antibodies, such as IgA and IgG. The antigen expressed by the recombinant vaccine was very exclusive. We explored a new form of possibility to deliver the virus into the gut, stimulating the specific mucosal immune response, which could directly neutralize the enterovirus at the site of infection.</p><p>Alginate microcapsules using ionic gelation represent a new and interesting approach to oral delivery systems for inactivating PEDV carriers. The microcapsules could efficiently capsulate the inactive PEDV antigen, and the whole virus particle was contained in the microcapsule. The microcapsules had good release profiles of the virus particles in saline solutions, such as PBS and normal saline, and the release rate was higher than 50% within three days. Studies have shown that the specific antibodies of IgA reach a peak in the second after immunization [<xref rid="B29-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The most important feature was the microcapsules protecting the integrity of virus particles in hydrochloric acid, which prevents the virus particles from being released and subsequently digested in gastric acid [<xref rid="B30-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Phage encapsulation and subsequent release kinetics revealed that the microcapsules possess pH-responsive characteristics with phage release triggered in an intestinal pH range suitable for therapeutic purposes [<xref rid="B31-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A number of previous studies have used alginate as the main encapsulating agent either on its own or in combination with chitosan [<xref rid="B32-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The chitosan&#x02013;alginate microspheres effectively protected the virus in simulated gastric conditions, showing the remaining viral titers. The chitosan&#x02013;alginate microspheres acted as an acid barrier in the simulated gastric conditions, helping the virus arrive at the M cell in the intestinal mucosal immune system. With storage at room temperature, the PEDV microcapsules displayed a remarkably low loss of antigen in the first three months, and they had good storage tolerance, thus maintaining the quality of the PEDV antigen. Tan reported that tocotrienols encapsulated in chitosan&#x02013;alginate microcapsules have effective storage tolerance in the yogurt matrix [<xref rid="B34-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>PEDV initially attacks neonatal intestinal epithelial cells in piglets and the intestinal tract system, inducing diarrhea clinical signs, but systemic lymphoid organs cannot provide the effective antibody IgG to neutralize this virus in the neonatal pig. They mainly depend on the innate immunity of maternal antibodies. Thus, we chose microcapsules carrying inactive PEDV to stimulate the mucosal immune system of neonatal piglets. The specific antibodies against IgA and IgG showed that the microcapsules stimulated the mucosal and systemic immune systems producing specific antibodies, such as IgA and IgG [<xref rid="B5-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the first mouse immunization experiment, the microcapsule groups had higher levels of antibodies than the inactivated PEDV group. Most importantly, the immunization of microcapsules in specific antibody production was dose-dependent, and the levels of specific IgA and IgG in the high-dose microcapsule group were significantly higher than those in the low-dose microcapsule group. There was a close connection between the specific neutralization of antibody titers and the dose dependence of microcapsules arriving at the mucosal surface. The results of 50% neutralization with specific IgG and IgA were also found during microcapsule immunization, and PEDV (high) microcapsule groups had better neutralizing activity than PEDV (low) microcapsule groups. The specific antibody of IgA had a greater efficiency of neutralization than the specific antibody of IgG in the same group. The main reason was that chitosan&#x02013;alginate microcapsules stimulate humoral immunity at the mucosal area, which is mainly mediated by IgA antibodies as the predominant immunoglobulin, and serum-derived IgG also contributes to immune defense [<xref rid="B35-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Specific antibody experiments have indicated that microcapsules stimulate specific mucosal and systemic immunity in mice. However, the mice are not the infecting hosts of PEDV, which means there is just the possibility of an immune response in piglets. There are many differences in immunization and infection between mice and neonatal pigs.</p><p>Virus particle carriers have shown higher potential as oral delivery systems of proteins and peptides, which are taken up by M-cells of Peyer&#x02019;s patches in the gut [<xref rid="B35-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. As seen in the qRT-PCR results, the microcapsules of PEDV, which have been reported to immunize with microcapsules, were associated with higher levels of IFN-&#x003b3; production related to the T helper 1 (Th1)-type immune response [<xref rid="B36-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In contrast, immunization with microcapsules without PEDV promoted IL-4 secretion related to the Th2-type immune response. IFN-&#x003b3; production was higher than IL-4 production after PEDV microcapsule immunization. The cellular immune response (Th1) and humoral immune response (Th2) were disrupted, and the Th1 type immune response was predominant [<xref rid="B6-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In particular, the high-dose PEDV microcapsules enhance IFN-&#x003b3; expression, which means that the PEDV microcapsule immunization mediates the T helper 1 (Th1)-type immune response, and the chitosan&#x02013;alginate plays an immunoregulatory role in extroversion to the cellular immune response. The mouse oral immunization of recombinant <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus casei</italic> expressing the Dendritic Cell-Targeting Peptide Fusing COE Protein of PEDV also mediated the Th1 immune response in piglets [<xref rid="B37-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The cytokine response was also analyzed to compare the inflammation, cellular and humoral immunity in oral immunization with PEDV microcapsules. IL-1 and TNF-&#x003b1; were also used to analyze the safety and inflammation with immunization, which did not stimulate the inflammatory response when using the oral PEDV microcapsules. Many more studies have demonstrated the chitosan&#x02013;alginate induction of the Th1-type immune response for oral vaccination in mice, and studies on the effects of chitosan have indicated that chitosan-fed farm animals showed higher weight gains but a lower incidence of disease than unfed animals [<xref rid="B38-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>DC-specific delivery has been considered a promising strategy for facilitating the efficient recognition, processing, and presentation of antigens by DCs, leading to enhanced antigen-specific immunity. The dendritic cell-targeted chitosan nanoparticles for nasal DNA immunization suggest that targeted pDNA delivery through a noninvasive intranasal route can be a strategy for designing low-dose vaccines [<xref rid="B41-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Without adjuvant immunization, the increase in CD11c+ during vaccination promotes germinal center induction and robust humoral responses [<xref rid="B42-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. When injected, these alginate &#x02018;vaccination nodes&#x02019; containing activated DCs attracted both host dendritic cells and a large number of T-cells to the injection sites in mice, while some of the inoculated DCs trafficked to the draining lymph nodes [<xref rid="B43-animals-13-00889" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Compared with the inactivated PEDV group, chitosan&#x02013;alginate groups, such as high-dose PEDV microcapsules and low-dose PEDV microcapsules, significantly stimulated the CD11c+ increase after the last immunization. Taking the advantage of CD11c+ in vivo DC targeting into consideration, chitosan&#x02013;alginate could presumably induce in vivo DC maturation more robustly than inactivated PEDV. The chitosan&#x02013;alginate could first effectively induce DC maturation of CD11c+ through the interaction with immunoregulation of chitosan&#x02013;alginate in the gut, which enhanced the specific immune response, inducing subsequent humoral immunity with mucosal immunity and the systemic immune response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-animals-13-00889"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>The oral microencapsulation was packaged with different titers of inactivated PEDV, which consisted of alginate and chitosan arriving and presenting to the gut in mice. It induced specific humoral and mucosal immunity. Specific antibodies from immunized mice, such as IgA and IgG, neutralized PEDV in vitro. Oral immunization also stimulated immunologic memory in mice. Alginate and chitosan not only act as capsule wall materials but also enhance the viability of immune cells such as DCs and B cells with the function of adjuvants. To the best of our knowledge, this study of microencapsulation is the first to package enterovirus in the immunization of mice even though the host of PEDV is pigs. Therefore, the host animals, pigs, should be studied with inactivated and microencapsulated PEDV.
