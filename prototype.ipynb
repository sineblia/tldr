Scientific research on pet emotion is in its early stages and pet owners are currently one of the best sources of information because they spend so much time with their animals. In this online survey, 438 owners were asked whether their dogs and/or cats could express 22 different emotions. If they answered ‘yes’, they were then asked how they identify that emotion in their pet. Owners believed dogs could feel more emotions than cats, and that they could use different sets of behavioral signs to identify different dog/cat emotions. The number of reported dog emotions tended to increase with the owner’s increased personal experience with dogs but decreased with the owner’s increased professional experience with dogs. Owners who owned both cats and dogs believed that cats could feel fewer emotions than owners that owned only cats. These owner perceptions are useful in advancing research in the field of animal emotions as they provide a starting point for validating each emotion in these species.', 'abstract': 'The correct interpretation of an animal’s emotional state is crucial for successful human–animal interaction. When studying dog and cat emotional expressions, a key source of information is the pet owner, given the extensive interactions they have had with their pets. In this online survey we asked 438 owners whether their dogs and/or cats could express 22 different primary and secondary emotions, and to indicate the behavioral cues they relied upon to identify those expressed emotions. Overall, more emotions were reported in dogs compared to cats, both from owners that owned just one species and those that owned both. Although owners reported a comparable set of sources of behavioral cues (e.g., body posture, facial expression, and head posture) for dogs and cats in expressing the same emotion, distinct combinations tended to be associated with specific emotions in both cats and dogs. Furthermore, the number of emotions reported by dog owners was positively correlated with their personal experience with dogs but negatively correlated with their professional experience. The number of emotions reported in cats was higher in cat-only households compared to those that also owned dogs. These results provide a fertile ground for further empirical investigation of the emotional expressions of dogs and cats, aimed at validating specific emotions in these species.'}\n",

In Asia, including Mongolia, infections are associated with the zoonotic HEV-3 and HEV-4 genotypes, and pigs, deer, and wild boars are the main reservoirs. Recent studies have revealed that sheep are hosts of the virus in several countries. The aim of our study is to diagnose HEV RNA in feces and liver samples of sheep in Mongolia and clarify the origin of the virus and characterize its chain of infection. From our results, we found HEV genotype 4 in sheep and it was closely related to pig HEV genotype 4 in the same region. On Mongolian pig farms, pigs are fed with the raw internal organs of sheep for fattening the pigs as a free resource of protein. There is a concern that the spread of HEV could affect livestock feeding.', 'abstract': 'Hepatitis E is a viral infectious disease in pigs, wild boars, cows, deer, rabbits, camels, and humans as hosts caused by '}\n",
      "{'simple_summary': 'Manganese is a trace element with many critical physiological functions, which should be supplied to animals and humans through diet. Since goose meat is eaten in many countries worldwide, this study aimed to systematically review the content of this element in goose meat and its relation to the recommended intake at the level of adequate intake (AI) and nutrient reference values-requirements (NRV-R). Already 100 g of goose meat can cover the daily AI per Mn for a wide range of adults, depending on the thermal treatment used. Placing information on the content of Mn in goose meat and the percentage of NRV-R on the packaging may be valuable information for the consumer in terms of making food choices to diversify the diet. Consumption of goose meat containing manganese may be justified in people struggling with mental disorders (depression, anxiety disorders), lipid (hypercholesterolemia), and carbohydrate metabolism (reduced glucose tolerance), in whom reduced concentration of this element has been confirmed in blood.', 'abstract': 'Manganese is a trace element with essential physiological functions that should be supplied to animals and humans through diet. Goose meat is prevalent in many regions of the world. Therefore, the aim of the study was a systematic review (PRISMA statement, 1980–2022) of the content of Mn in raw and cooked goose meat and their relation to the recommended intake at the level of adequate intake (AI) and the nutrient reference values-requirements (NRV-R). The literature analysis shows that the content of Mn in goose meat depends on the breed, type of muscles, the presence of skin, and the cooking method used. AI level recommendations for Mn intake range from 0.003 to 5.50 mg/day, depending on the country, age, and gender. Consumption by adults (regardless of sex) of 100 g of domestic or wild goose meat covers the daily AI per Mn in various percentages, depending on the type of muscles (more Mn in leg muscles), presence of skin (more Mn in skinless muscles), and thermal treatment (pan fried with oil, grilled, and cooked meat contains more). Placing information on the Mn content in goose meat and the percentage of NRV-R on the packaging may be valuable information for the consumer in making food choices to diversify the diet. There are few studies on the content of Mn in goose meat. Therefore, it is reasonable to conduct research in this area.'}\n",

It identifies some of the potential consequences—intentional and unintentional—of this type of ‘solutionism’ and proposes a wider discussion about reducing livestock numbers and thinking with planetary boundaries to promote sustainable animal production systems. The argument is illustrated through findings from an interdisciplinary research project on cattle production in Denmark.', 'abstract': 'The increased attention drawn to the negative environmental impact of the cattle industry has fostered a host of market- and research-driven initiatives among relevant actors. While the identification of some of the most problematic environmental impacts of cattle is seemingly more or less unanimous, solutions are complex and might even point in opposite directions. Whereas one set of solutions seeks to further optimize sustainability pr. unit produced, e.g., by exploring and altering the relations between elements kinetically moving one another inside the cow’s rumen, this opinion points to different paths. While acknowledging the importance of possible technological interventions to optimize what occurs inside the rumen, we suggest that broader visions of the potential negative outcomes of further optimization are also needed. Accordingly, we raise two concerns regarding a focus on solving emissions through feedstuff development. First, we are concerned about whether the development of feed additives overshadows discussions about downscaling and, second, whether a narrow focus on reducing enteric gasses brackets other relations between cattle and landscapes. Our hesitations are rooted in a Danish context, where the agricultural sector—mainly a large-scale technologically driven livestock production—contributes significantly to the total emission of CO'}\n",

Several alternative methods to chemicals have been sought to control tick infestations in cattle, which are practical and friendly to the environment. In this work, we implement rotational grazing to combat ticks at the pasture level. We found that a 30-day rest period for pastures (without animals) is not enough to reduce the presence of ticks in animals but that a 45-day rest period does reduce the presence of ticks in cattle. These studies are critical since they would help cattle producers design better strategies that help reduce the use of chemical acaricides and the presence of chemicals in milk, meat, and the environment.', 'abstract': 'Rotational grazing has been mentioned as a potential tool to reduce losses caused by high tick loads.

We also evaluated whether the composition of these elements varies between sites along the coast of the Baja California Peninsula and the potential risk to human health if red crab is consumed as food.

Australian calf rearing recommendations have changed very little in the last 30 years, with recent studies considering them inadequate. Early-life nutrition is widely understood to affect the development of physiological systems in all species; it is therefore essential that effective calf rearing strategies are in place to produce resilient cows to ensure a productive and profitable dairy industry. This experiment followed 20 heifer calves from birth to weaning and investigated the effects of two preweaning nutritional strategies (Low: 4 L or High: 8 L of milk per day) on growth, immune competence, and metabolic characteristics. The physiological systems were compared between treatments in response to an immune challenge in the form of a vaccination. Calves fed a higher milk volume in the preweaning phase had superior growth, immune and metabolic characteristics than calves on the restricted milk diet. Therefore, these results do not support the current industry practice of restricted milk feeding calves. Developments in this area could provide new management approaches improving health, welfare and profitability in the dairy industry.', 'abstract': 'Feeding increased volumes of milk in the preweaning phase has been shown to improve growth, morbidity and mortality rates in calves ('}\n",

It is important to do so, as legislation demands that humane endpoints or intervention points be implemented by scientists when appropriate during an experiment. Herein, I describe a scheme that is objective and avoids subjective assessments. It can be applied to many types of experiments and for most species of animals used in research. It has the additional advantage that the type of adverse effect does not have to be specified, e.g., pain, distress, suffering or lasting harm, as it measures the impact of the experiment on the animals, which is more likely to reflect their emotional state. The scheme can also be used to assess the effectiveness of any alleviative therapy.', 'abstract': 'This paper presents and illustrates, with a working example, a hypothesis for the assessment of ongoing severity before and during an experiment that will enable humane endpoints and intervention points to be applied accurately and reproducibly, as well as helping to implement any national legal severity limits in subacute and chronic animal experiments, e.g., as specified by the competent authority. The underlying assumption of the model framework is that the degree of deviation from normality of specified measurable biological criteria will reflect the level of pain, suffering, distress and lasting harm incurred by or during an experiment. The choice of criteria will normally reflect the impact on an animal and have to be chosen by scientists and those caring for the animals. They will usually include measurements of good health such as temperature, body weight, body condition and behaviour, which vary according to the species, husbandry and experimental protocols and, in some species, unusual parameters such as time of the year (e.g., migrating birds). In animal research legislation, endpoints or severity limits may be specified so that individual animals do not suffer unnecessarily or endure severe pain and distress that is long-lasting (Directive 2010/63/EU, Art.15.2). In addition, the overall severity is estimated and classified as part of the harm: benefit licence assessment. I present a mathematical model to analyse the measurement data to determine the degree of harm (or severity) incurred. The results can be used to initiate alleviative treatment if required or if permitted during the course of an experiment. In addition, any animal determined to have breached the severity classification of a procedure can be humanely killed, treated or withdrawn from the experiment.

This study aims to determine the impact of the methane fermentation process carried out in two agricultural biogas plants on the efficiency of sanitization of pig slurry, input biomass, and digestate. The biogas plants differed in terms of the substrate used; one used pig slurry from a maternal (breeding) farm (BP-M), and the other utilized pig slurry from a fattening farm (BP-F). The physicochemical analyses showed that the slurry, input biomass, and digestate from the BP-F were characterized by a significantly higher contents of organic dry matter, ash, and ammonium nitrogen than the slurry, input biomass, and digestate from the BP-M. The parameters of the methane fermentation process, including temperature and pH, reached higher values in the BP-F compared to the BP-M. The microbiological analyses led to the conclusion that the efficiency of sanitization of input biomass, including pig slurry, was significantly higher in the BP-F compared to the BP-M. Due to the above findings, locating biogas plants near pig fattening farms should be recommended.'}\n",
      "{'simple_summary': 'The restriction of feed intake in sows during the gestation period is important for the livestock producer due to the prevention of excess body weight gain and fat deposition, leading to low reproductive performance and detrimental effects at farrowing and during lactation. The frustration caused by feed restriction is the major factor in developing stereotypic behaviors in sows and the occurrence of this behavior may be associated with sows being hungry. Therefore, several strategies have been employed to ameliorate the stereotypic behaviors in sows. Feeding sows a high-fiber diet is the most effective method to increase postprandial satiety, thereby improving the welfare of sows subjected to feed restriction during pregnancy. There are a number of fibrous ingredients available, including wheat middlings, corn germ, sugar beet pulp, corn gluten feed, soy hulls, dried grass, and alfalfa meal. However, the effect of fiber-rich diets on satiety and behavior depends on the dietary fiber sources (physicochemical properties) or fiber inclusion rate in the diet. The objective of this review is to discuss the functional roles of dietary fiber sources with different inclusion levels reducing abnormal behaviors in sows.', 'abstract': 'This review aims to discuss the effects of dietary fiber sources with various levels on stereotypic behaviors in sows. There are a variety of dietary fiber sources that are supplemented to feeds for sows. However, dietary fiber sources have different physio-chemical properties, leading to controversial results in feed motivation, nutrient digestibility, and behaviors in sows fed fiber-rich diets. Findings from previous studies indicated that soluble fiber delays nutrient absorption and decreases physical activity after feeding. In addition to this, it increases volatile fatty acid production, provides energy, and prolongs the feeling of satiety. It also prevents certain stereotypies and thus is paramount to sow welfare.'}\n",

In this context, the protein requirement of piglets, which are in a phase of rapid growth, may be greater than the intestine’s ability to digest proteins. Undigested proteins are the best pabulum for the proliferation of the pathogenic bacterial flora that causes diarrhea.

Subcutaneous implants of this hormone have been used to modulate this seasonality. Nowadays, consumers are increasingly concerned about organic, hormone-free production. In order to adapt sheep production to these new demands, it would be of interest to replace synthetic melatonin with phytomelatonin, which is present in plants and can be included in sheep diet. In addition, if phytomelatonin comes from by-products from the food industry, a further step would be taken towards the objectives of the circular economy. Thus, the main objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of phytomelatonin-rich diets on ram sperm quality and seminal plasma composition. With this work, we found that a phytomelatonin-rich diet, including a mix of grape pulp, and pomegranate and tomato pomaces, can increase melatonin levels in seminal plasma, improve sperm viability and morphology, and protect sperm cells against oxidative damage.', 'abstract': 'The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a phytomelatonin-rich diet, including by-products from the food industry, on ram sperm quality and seminal plasma composition.

Finally, 20% of a mix of grape pulp with pomegranate and tomato pomaces was included in the rams’ diet, constituting the phytomelatonin-rich diet. Feeding the rams with this diet resulted in an increase in seminal plasma melatonin levels compared with the control group (commercial diet) in the third month of the study. In addition, percentages higher than those in the control group of morphologically normal viable spermatozoa with a low content of reactive oxygen species were observed from the second month onwards. However, the antioxidant effect does not seem to be exerted through the modulation of the antioxidant enzymes since the analysis of the activities of catalase, glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase in seminal plasma revealed no significant differences between the two experimental groups.

A total of 65 PGs underwent segmentation and texture feature extraction (48 PGs were included in the pSS control group, and 17 PGs were included in the pSS NHL group). Following parameter reduction techniques, univariate analysis, multivariate regression, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis, the following TA parameters proved to be independently associated with NHL development in pSS: CH4S6_Sum_Variance and CV4S6_Inverse_Difference_Moment, with an area under ROC of 0.800 and 0.875, respectively. The radiomic model (resulting by combining the two previously independent TA features), presented 94.12% sensitivity and 85.42% specificity in differentiating between the two studied groups, reaching the highest area under ROC of 0.931 for the chosen cutoff value of 1.556. This study suggests the potential role of radiomics in revealing new imaging biomarkers that might serve as useful predictors for lymphoma development in patients with pSS. Further research on multicentric cohorts is warranted to confirm the obtained results and the added benefit of TA in risk stratification for patients with pSS.'}\n",

Welfare is important for the bull industry because, apart from the known consequences of stress on reproductive parameters and performance, stress can also influence the onset of puberty and cause other health problems. Therefore, it would be useful to have an early indicator of an incipient welfare problem so that countermeasures could be taken in time to prevent such long-term effects on the animals. Different protocols have been developed for specific animal species and production groups/systems based on their biology, husbandry, management, and breeding, and care guidelines formulated.

The development of the mammary glands is slowed during the embryonic period due to factors such as inadequate nutrition, which directly affect the development of the mammary glands and lactation after birth. However, the impact of embryonic nutrition on fetal mammary gland development is often unnoticed. We investigate the effect of nutritional intake on embryonic mammary gland development by administering different levels of nutritional restriction to female mice during gestation. Contrary to common belief, we found that mild maternal nutritional restriction contributes to mammary gland development in the offspring. Mammary gland dysplasia is not obvious until maternal nutritional restriction reaches 70% of the normal intake. Further embryonic mammary gland development studies can be performed based on our level of maternal nutritional restriction.

      "{'simple_summary': 'The European pig industry needs to adapt to growing social interest regarding animal welfare. One of these concerns is the surgical castration of male piglets—a common practice primarily performed to avoid the risk of boar taint released from the meat of uncastrated males, especially during heat treatment. Several EU countries are trying to stop the surgical castration of pigs. The European Commission (EC) strongly supports these activities. One of the two currently feasible alternatives to the production of castrates is the fattening of entire male pigs. It is well known that skatole, one of two main compounds responsible for boar taint, can be eliminated or reduced by feeding additives. Recently, some promising results have been achieved using hydrolysable tannins in the diet of entire males. However, it should be mentioned that these studies focused on the influence of tannins on fattening, carcass value, meat quality and the deposition of androstenone and skatole in adipose tissue but not their influence on sensory characteristics. Therefore, the objective of this study was, in addition to determining the effects of tannins on skatole and androstenone accumulation in fatty tissue, to assess the sensory attributes of pork from entire males after supplementation of the diet with 1–4% tannins. The results showed that 2–4% supplementation of tannins in the feed reduced the accumulation of skatole in fatty tissue. The odour and flavour of pork were not influenced by tannin supplementation, but higher doses of tannins decreased the juiciness and tenderness of pork from entire males but only in men’s evaluation. The effect of the sex of the panellists on both of these sensory traits was observed in both the control and tannin-supplemented groups.', 'abstract': 'Boar taint is an unpleasant odour and flavour released during heat treatment of pork from uncastrated male pigs. The two main compounds responsible for boar taint are androstenone and skatole. Androstenone is a steroid hormone formed in the testis during sexual maturity. Skatole is a product of microbial degradation of the amino acid tryptophan in the hindgut of pigs. Both of these compounds are lipophilic, which means that they can be deposited in adipose tissue. Several studies have reported heritability estimates for their deposition from medium (skatole) to high magnitudes (androstenone). In addition to efforts to influence boar taint through genetic selection, much attention has also been paid to reducing its incidence using various feeding strategies. From this point of view, research has focused especially on the reduction in skatole content by supplementation of feed additives into the nutrition of entire male pigs. Promising results have been achieved using hydrolysable tannins in the diet. To date, most studies have investigated the effects of tannins on the production and accumulation of skatole in adipose tissue, intestinal microbiota, growth rate, carcasses and pork quality. Thus, the objective of this study was, in addition to determining the effects of tannins on androstenone and skatole accumulation, to assess the effects of tannins on the sensory traits of meat from entire males.

Research instruments consisted of a demographic sheet, the Ethics Position Questionnaire (EPQ), the Animal Attitude Scale—10-Item Version (AAS-10), and Animal Issue Scale (AIS). The study hypotheses were explored by employing various statistical analyses like Pearson Product Moment Correlation, independent sample t-test, ANOVA, and linear regression.

Introduction', 'content': ['Dogs and cats may provide a wide range of health, emotional, behavioral, cognitive, educational, and social benefits to humans, and support economic growth [', 'Considering the importance of understanding emotion in human–animal interactions, we know surprisingly little about what extent dogs and cats express a typical range of emotions and what behavioral signs are indicative to humans for potentially detecting these emotions. This lack of information may be due to inherent challenges in studying emotion in nonhuman animals, as their behavior and communicative signals vary greatly from our own and we cannot rely on language to help bridge the gap. Furthermore, human emotion perception and processes seem to be preferentially adapted to conspecifics, but we may adopt an identical or similar process to perceive and interpret both conspecific and heterospecific emotional cues [', 'However, regardless of their ability or performance in identifying animal emotions, pet owners are arguably an important potential data source for studying companion animal emotions because of their intensive interaction with their pets, their experience of emotional triggers and contexts associated with specific pet emotions, and their knowledge or sensitivity to subtle pet emotional behaviors. Although this data source is naturally subjective and susceptible to anthropomorphic bias (i.e., attributing human emotion characteristics to animals), owner perception of pet emotions may provide consistent trends and collective evidence that could provide a fertile source for guiding further empirical research to determine whether these owner observations are accurate.', 'To date, only a few studies have examined owners’ beliefs about their pet’s emotions, with large variances between individual owners’ reports and between studies. Generally, dog and cat owners believed their pets could express a wide range of emotions, which can be grouped into primary/basic and secondary/complex emotions [', 'Furthermore, dog and cat owners may report differently about their pet’s emotions. In a recent survey, participants attributed primary emotions to both dogs and cats roughly equally (88% dogs vs. 87% cats); however, secondary emotions were only reported by 44% of cat owners, compared to 55% of dog owners [', 'Regarding the large variances in the reported number and type of emotions across dog and cat owners, this might be caused by both individual differences in owners and breed differences in dogs/cats. According to recent studies, the number of owner-reported pet emotions or the accuracy in recognizing pet emotional expression images could be affected by an owner’s gender and age [', 'To address these potential confounding factors in previous research, in the current study we aimed to directly compare the number of emotions reported by dog and cat owners, both in homes with only one species and homes with both species, using an extended emotion list including primary and secondary emotions commonly reported in both human and animal emotion research e.g., [', 'We also requested owners to indicate the common animal arousal, signaling, and behavioral tendency signs used by them to detect specific animal emotions [']}, {'title': '2.

No respondents completed the survey for multiple dogs or cats of different breeds.']}, {'title': '4. Discussion', 'content': ['The three objectives of this exploratory study were to (1) directly compare dog and cat owners’ beliefs about the number of emotions their pets could express, (2) evaluate what behavioral changes were associated with each emotional expression by owners, and (3) analyze the influence of various owner and pet-related factors on the owners’ belief. Regarding the 1st objective, our analysis revealed that pet owners only reported more anger in cats than in dogs and a more frequent expression of two other primary and eight secondary emotions in dogs (', 'Nonetheless, domestication history may also be important. Dogs were historically selected to work for humans, in roles typically requiring frequent heterospecific communication and understanding [', 'The fact that cats are semi-solitary animals may also explain why anger was the only emotion reported significantly more frequently in cats than in dogs by cat-only owners. For instance, aggressive behavior may be more common in cat-only households with multiple cats competing for key resources and territorial boundaries [', 'Regarding the second objective, our analysis revealed that both dog and cat owners tended to rely on a comparable set of sources of behavioral cues, especially body posture, facial expression, and head posture, to detect their pet’s emotions, indicating the important role of nonfacial cues in identifying animal emotions. As the facial expression is generally the dominant channel of emotional expression in human–human emotional perception [', 'The pet (especially dog) owners further believed that many different categories of animal emotions were associated with distinctive combinations of behavioral cues, such as changes in facial expression and body posture for dog embarrassment, and changes in proximity to the owner and physical contact for dog empathy (', 'Regarding the third objective, our analysis revealed that the number of reported dog emotions had a tendency to increase with owners’ increasing personal experience with dogs, but decrease with increasing professional experience with dogs. As reading a dog’s body language and multimodal emotional behavior is likely to involve a social learning process, longer dog ownership may allow the owners to pick up on subtle changes in their dog’s behavior and to be familiar with (or sensitive to) different emotional triggers and contexts. This might enable them to report more (especially complex secondary) dog emotions. It could also be argued that this longer dog ownership would result in a stronger emotional bond between owner and dog with a concomitant increased risk of anthropomorphism and humanization bias toward their dogs [', 'Furthermore, the number of reported cat emotions was reduced significantly if cat owners also had a dog at home (the results for dogs were similar regardless of any cats in the house). One interpretation is that cats may behave differently (e.g., being repressed and less expressive) if they live with dogs compared to if they live alone or with other cats. Owners may also report fewer cat emotions if they spend less time with the cat because the dog is always close by. However, it is worth mentioning that most dogs and cats can share a house peacefully, and tend to choose to spend time in the same room every day [', 'It should be noted that the generalization of these reported research findings might be constrained by the limits of our sample population. For instance, the participating pet owners were dominated by female (87%) and Caucasian (90%) participants, as is common in such work. Given that the owners’ gender and cultural background may affect their ability to perceive dog emotions [', 'Nevertheless, the variation in the number of emotions reported between species has several implications, both for animal welfare and human health and safety. One potential implication is that the emotional states of cats, particularly those living with dogs, are being overlooked or interpreted incorrectly. This could mean that the welfare needs of cats are not being met in terms of reducing the incidences of negative emotions (sadness, frustration, boredom, etc.) and increasing the opportunities to elicit positive emotions (happiness, amusement, etc.). If the findings are driven by owners having a relatively less positive belief in cats compared to dogs, this could also affect how they treat their cats (e.g., the misattribution of cat fear as anger may lead to the use of positive punishment, negatively impacting the cat’s welfare). Furthermore, being unable to interpret subtle cat behavioral cues may put an owner at risk. For example, petting-related aggression often occurs because owners miss those subtle cues indicating that the cat wants the owner to stop touching them [', 'Conversely, it is also possible that the emotional capabilities of dogs are being exaggerated and/or misinterpreted because of increased anthropomorphism and humanization trends in dog owners. Believing dogs are just another member of the family can lead to welfare issues. If owners do not appreciate how different dogs are, particularly concerning their communicative signals, they may interpret dog signals in a human-like way more frequently. For example, the reported sources of behavioral cues for detecting guilt/shame in dogs were ‘head posture’, ‘body posture’, and ‘eye contact’, with the most likely scenario being a dog that is holding its head low, contracting its body and avoiding eye contact. In fact, these behaviors are typically associated with a fearful, deferent, or submissive dog, and so scolding the dog when he exhibits these behaviors may exacerbate the dog’s fear/anxiety [']}, {'title': '5. Conclusions', 'content': ['This online study compared owners’ perceptions of their dogs’ and cats’ emotional expressions. Overall, more emotions were reported in dogs compared to cats, both from owners that owned just one species and those that owned both. While dogs and cats used a comparable set of behavioral signs to express the same emotion, distinct combinations tended to be associated with specific emotions in both cats and dogs. Although owner beliefs and anthropomorphisms are problematic in many situations, they are helpful as a starting point for an objective definition of animal emotions. With current technology, it is difficult to confirm animal emotional states; however, validating or refuting these owner beliefs could be the next step in this direction. This should be a high-priority research area as it is evident that regardless of whether owners are underestimating the emotional abilities of cats or overestimating that of dogs (or perhaps both), there are potentially important consequences for both humans and the animals they hope to care for.']}]\n",

The HEV strain may be transmitted between farms via human and pig movement. Pigs are usually fed on the by-products of slaughterhouse-derived sheep’s internal organs. The pigs had no restrictions on their movement. Phylogenetic analysis of the ORF2 region revealed that the HEV genotypes in the infected pigs in the vicinity of Ulaanbaatar city are homologous to those in sheep. This could be because sheep co-graze near pig farms in the same area. In comparison with HEVs from sheep detected in Töv Province, phylogenetic analysis showed genetic similarity with PF121, PF101, and PF175 from pigs. The geographical distance between Bayanchandmani soum (the sheep sample area) and Songino Khairkhan district intersects with livestock movement and feed distribution. Therefore, it is quite possible that HEV of livestock origin between the same regions could be transmitted via various routes. Mongolian sheep and goats usually co-graze in pasturelands together with other livestock, including cattle. We assume that sheep are not HEV reservoirs but are spillover infected animals.

For infants aged 7 to 11 months, an AI of 0.02–0.5 mg/day is suggested, reflecting the wide range of manganese intakes that appear to be adequate for this age group.

      "[{'title': '1. A Commentary on Feed Additives as Solutions to Cattle’s Climate Impact', 'content': ['Since 2006, when the much-quoted FAO report Livestock’s Long Shadow [', 'The fact that domesticated animals produced around the world (mainly cattle, pigs, and poultry) now outnumber wild mammals and birds by a factor of ten no doubt adds pressure to this predicament [', 'While the identification of some of the most problematic environmental impacts of cattle is seemingly more or less unanimous, solutions are complex and might even point in opposite directions. As is clear from this special issue, one set of solutions points to interventions into the causal relations of elements kinetically moving one another inside the cow’s rumen. More specifically, feed additives of various sorts are developed to decrease the generation of methane, thus targeting climate change. Surely, these interventions are valuable—after all, in these critical, increasingly hot times, why oppose GHG reductions in whatever form and by whatever means? Nonetheless, in this short contribution, we raise two concerns regarding a focus on solving emissions through feedstuff development. Whereas knowledge about the possibilities of technological optimization is important, we suggest that broader visions of the possible negative outcomes of further optimization are also needed. Notably, we are concerned for two reasons: First, the development of feed additives may overshadow discussions about downscaling. Second, a narrow focus on reducing enteric gasses by manipulating a set of kinetic causal processes inside the rumen may bracket other relations between cattle and landscapes. Both of these consequences, we suggest, can potentially limit the scope of climate impact mitigation in relation to cattle. Below, we substantiate these reservations and go on to probe how the development of feed additives sit with ideas about absolute sustainability and safe operating spaces for humanity. Our approach to the issue of feed additives and cattle production is rooted in anthropology and cultural history. We thus work using a method of ethnographic fieldwork among stakeholders engaged in Danish cattle production, and we conduct document analysis of, e.g., policies and public discussions, just as we look to archival and historical literature to trace earlier connections between state making and livestock production in Denmark.']}, {'title': '2.

In other words, addressing the issue of methane emission through conceptualizing the rumen as a discrete and singular site of intervention may occlude the concern both with a potential rise in scale and with other the well-known, environmentally harmful effects of maintaining present-scale livestock production [']}, {'title': '4.

On both accounts, we suggest, there is a need to consider how technological and natural scientific solutions to the methane issue relate to a planet with boundaries that limit a safe operating space for humanity [', 'If, as we suggest, technological solutions ‘work back’ on the identification of what the problem even is, the result is too easily a circular argument; we can only see the problems that we think we can solve by way of technology—rather than by a just and green societal transition, sanctioned in progressive politics. In making this argument, and exploring how it works in a Danish context, we draw on the model of planetary boundaries originally suggested by Rockström et al. [']}, {'title': '6. A Couple of Examples', 'content': ['To substantiate our argument, below we will look at a couple of instances where feed additives are discussed in a Danish context. We do so via ethnographic fieldwork, where we engage with stakeholders such as researchers and politicians, as well as with various written sources. Our method is ethnographic in the sense that we trace relations and generate analyses in dialogue with the field; as such, we explore what feed additives may be as they are produced and discussed by people who develop, implement, or entrust them with positive effects for mitigating climate change—see also [', 'What we want to point to here is that the means for a very large proportion of the CO', 'Another example from our fieldwork sheds light on the potential unintended effects of implementing feed additive solutions. Below, we provide more detail regarding some of the ways that feed additives work in the practices and discussions of industrial agriculture stakeholders. At the annual Cattle Congress 2022, the head of the Cattle Section in SEGES Innovation—the Danish agricultural interest organization’s independent research unit—together with a researcher from the same organization, gave a talk under the headline “Climate Requirements in the Agricultural Agreement”—the same deal mentioned above. From her point of view, climate requirements can be answered by two distinct means of action: the handling of digestion and manure—while not compromising another distinct theme, namely animal welfare. In this way, she framed the problems involved in having an agricultural sector accounting for over one fourth of Danish GHG emissions by setting a very particular triangular frame within which one should think, talk, research, and act in relation to climate requirements: welfare, digestion, and manure. ', 'She mentioned that feeding with additives could reduce 20% of the 0.17 million tons CO', 'What interests us here is that the talk can be seen as combining the launch of a solution with calling for further tests, thereby mimicking the agreement above in its expectations for future effects of something yet to be fully developed and tested. Interestingly, a person in the audience raised his hand and questioned the manure from cattle fed with the approved additive, asking whether the emissions from it altered when distributed on the fields. In response, the researcher answered that the amount of product used is so small, and further that the product is processed so quickly in the cow that it was very unlikely that it would have an effect elsewhere, outside the rumen. However, he continued, researchers in Canada have recently conducted a study where they pointed to higher emissions from manure in the fields as an effect of the application of feed additives. Interestingly, this Canadian study—or hesitation, we could call it—did not seem to ‘alter’ the Danish researcher’s hopes for feed additives once they have been further tested. Chatting with the researcher after the talk, it became clear that potentially increased emissions on the fields were understood as a problem for another research field—namely, that which deals with manure handling. For him, it seemed, there were so many kinetic relations to be explored within the rumen, and understanding what happens later, out on the fields, would be a theme to be researched once processes in the rumen are more fully understood. Our point here is to highlight the decoupling of what goes on in the rumen upon applying feed additives from the ‘afterlife’ of such an intervention. ']}, {'title': '7. Conclusion: Heeding all Biosphere Domains at Once', 'content': ['To conclude, what we argue—and the reason for our reservations towards the prevalent kind of solutionism offered by the development of feed additives—is that it takes a very particular perspective on the cow for its rumen to be the sole target of any intervention. From this perspective, the cow is a singular unit from within which technology can decrease methane emission. To the contrary, as anthropologists, we would see any cow as a set of relations, ranging from the microbial level to global issues of deforestation [']}]\n",

Severity comprises two components: the intensity of the adverse state such as pain or distress and, secondly, its duration. Another factor to consider when calculating the overall animal welfare impact of an experiment is any cumulative suffering, for example, inadequate husbandry, in addition to the experimental procedures, the number of times an animal is subjected to a repeated technique (e.g., injections) or procedure or any additional procedures in more complex protocols. Short-term intense stressors may also have long-term impacts, e.g., on the immune system. It is possible to determine the overall animal ‘cost’ in terms of harms in a series of experiments by including the number of animals affected.', 'In competent humans, the assessment of suffering usually relies on verbal reporting of some sort, whereas in babies and other non-verbal or non-communicating humans and non-human animals, other methods have to be used. In animals, an estimate of the intensity of suffering can be made by measuring the impact of an experimental protocol on an animal, i.e., the degree to which it has deviated from normality compared with a control naïve group kept in a similar or the same way. The duration of any suffering is the second most important component of severity and is far easier to measure objectively, although it is often not specified. The combination of intensity and duration is used to estimate ‘severity’. The advantage of measuring impact by deviation from normal in this way is that it does not require the type of adverse state experienced to be explicit, that is, it does not need to be defined as pain, physical dystress (a state of stressor overstimulation of the endocrine system as first described by Moberg 1985) [', 'Considerable advances have been made in the details of these sorts of abnormalities and their observational robustness in many areas of research.

There is no limit to the number of criteria scored or the number of time points chosen, but in order to reduce workload, only the key and most relevant criteria should be used. These key criteria should also best reflect an animal’s adverse state and not simply repeat other closely correlated signs. In addition, the measured signs should reliably indicate severity, be robust, subject to little inter- or intraobserver variation, and be economical and easy to measure. Furthermore, the criteria measured should be independent of each other, for example, a failure to eat and body weight are usually closely interdependent.', 'The aim of this semiquantitative assessment is to be able to compare predicted and actual suffering and to express these estimates mathematically. In the following example, the deviation from normality or intensity is determined for each independent criterion for each animal in the group at a set time. This figure is then averaged to obtain a score for that criterion. The average score per animal is made up of the averages for each criterion. It is then possible to compare, for example, different experimental groups at the same time point, as well as at different time points in an experiment. The easiest way to understand this is to provide a simplified working example.', 'In a study of drug safety and effectiveness, several doses were given, and the rats were observed for adverse effects.

Conclusions', 'content': ['Many turfgrasses equine sports surfaces have different components than sand surfaces. However, in this experiment, the composition of the topsoil is closely related to a sand surface. The turfgrasses canopy adds another dimension to the interaction of the hoof–surface. The effect and the interaction of drainage and geotextile were tested with five devices. Previous studies on sand boxes were confirmed with the effect of drainage package and geotextile addition able to be detected with some of the simple instruments used in this experiment. In this study, TDR proved to be the most reliable tool, able to detect differences promoted by geotextile or drainage package despite the high moisture content. The effect of drainage on surface properties is likely to be related to the presence of both a vertical and horizontal water movement and the subsequent effect on packing particles that lead to higher VMC at higher water tension values and, in this sense, adding consistency. As in our previous study, the ability to test functional properties of the surface may be limited, however, due to the lower loads and lower load rates from these instruments. In addition, the turfgrasses canopy adds complexity through sward structure and variations in the height of mowing. These turfgrass properties contribute to the complex surface-hoof features and limit the ability to detect differences with simpler devices such as RPS, ITD, SCP, or GS. The different sensitivity of some tools like RPS, SPC, and GSI between dates highlights the interest in changes in the growth rate of shoots and roots and thickness of leaves regarding the season and affecting hoof-surface interaction. The lack of sensitivity of some devices may also be influenced by the method of turfgrass establishment. The turf was applied as sod, which included a 2 cm thick layer of silty clay soil which may be a barrier to the detection of drainage and geotextile treatments by the RPS and ITD. While future research may include washing the sod, this is not typically done in most installations. Moisture also plays a role in the lack of sensitivity of some devices. However, since the arenas or racetracks are outdoors, some combination of factors like drainage package and high volumetric moisture content may lead to turf with an off condition. Understanding the consequences of injury risk is the primary objective of the use of these tools.', 'Future work should consider alternative approaches that are also suited for monitoring the proper maintenance of the turfgrass surfaces.

Efforts to harmonize measures, examine the waiting period between scans and scan results, and identify intervention targets are particularly needed. Emerging literature indicates that some individuals may be more prone to elevated anxiety around the time of scans, and suggests promising approaches at the individual and clinic/system levels to help manage scanxiety. Given that scan experiences are common and repeated across the cancer continuum, strategies to support patients around these times have the potential to improve quality of life and other outcomes for those living with and beyond cancer.']}]\n",

Poor animal welfare can be easily missed due to a lack of knowledge of the species and insufficient evaluation. This can be avoided by using appropriate methods for animal welfare assessment.

Thereafter, hundreds of welfare assessment protocols were developed around the world; all differ from one another based not only on the animal species and production group but also on the place where the animals are kept at the time of evaluation.

In addition, semen collection is not a natural way of expressing reproduction behavior. All of these differences and specifics require detailed knowledge of AI bull physiology, behavior, and husbandry before defining criteria for welfare assessment. It might be possible to create a unique WAP for the specific conditions of AI bulls by analyzing different existing welfare assessment protocols and approaches to welfare assessment.

If a contamination event occurs, either planned (poisoning events for pest eradication) or unplanned (oil spills), the protection of wildlife can occur by: (1) stopping the contaminant from reaching and affecting non-target wildlife by containing poison in equipment that does not allow wildlife access or not spreading poison in critical wildlife areas, or containing the oil spill at or close to the source or stopping oil entering the wildlife habitat; (2) stopping wildlife being affected through the removal of wildlife from an affected or about to be affected area, or preventing wildlife from entering affected areas through hazing, deterrence, or pre-emptive capture. If these preventative measures are not undertaken, wildlife may die or need capture, cleaning, and/or medical treatment and rehabilitation before being released back into a clean environment. Avoiding wildlife from being impacted is always the highest priority as it prevents the duress, injury, and possible death of wildlife. Additionally, while it does have its own risks, it will significantly lessen the cost of a wildlife response if wildlife does become affected, and reduces the negative public and media reactions to reports and visual images of impacted wildlife [', 'The first step needed in all protective and preventative processes is developing a plan, based on analysis of areas at risk of impact (either oiling or where poison will be spread), the vulnerability of species (to both the contaminant and any proposed action), and potential response options for species at risk [', 'This manuscript uses past oil spills and pest eradications using toxicants on islands as case studies of pre-emptive capture and holding, or translocation, to highlight lessons learned and considerations of species-specific response option restrictions, and outlines recommendations to allow better use, preparedness, and planning for pre-emptive capture as a conservation tool for threatened wildlife during contamination events.']}, {'title': '2.

However, the case studies above outline how, with consideration and planning, particularly for planned eradication poison applications, pre-emptive capture or translocations can be successful and save significant proportions of populations or range-restricted species from potential extinction events.

Hence, to ensure the livelihoods of these farmers, it is important to control and prevent the incidence of PPR in their flocks.

These findings are also in agreement with those of earlier reports [', 'The perception of the veterinarians regarding the PPR-CP’s rollout revealed that the majority of the veterinarians concurred with the various activities implemented in Karnataka state, viz., the control programme was planned well, the vaccination programme was accepted by the farmers, proper coordination existed between various functionaries of PPR-CP, and they agreed upon the effectiveness of extension services. Furthermore, regarding the performance of the functional components of the control programme, the majority of the veterinarians perceived that vaccines were available on time in sufficient quantities, they could vaccinate the targeted animals on time, storage and cold-chain facilities were available, and they could manage the outbreaks on time. Though the majority of veterinarians expressed positive opinions on the existing PPR control plan, including its rollout and the performance of the various functional components implemented in the state, a few of the veterinarians disagreed and some remained neutral towards the plan per se, as well as towards the level of coordination between the functionaries, the availability of funding, and the programme’s acceptance by farmers. The veterinarians’ opinions regarding the improvement of the existing control programme included imparting training on vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, increasing the provision of funds for various activities, and increased coordination with various authorities. This implies that there is scope for improvement in the existing programme. Furthermore, since India is planning to eradicate PPR by 2025–2026, all facets of the programme need to be revisited, revised, implemented, and monitored on a regular basis and, more importantly, the perspectives of the important ‘gatekeepers’ in the PPR eradication programme, such as field veterinarians, need to be included in the current programme.

Furthermore, strong facilitation measures are needed from the federal government for the effective implementation of the eradication programme in these states and to ensure effective coordination between the states. Despite long years of vaccination against PPR, the benefits outweigh the costs, mainly because of the low cost of the vaccine (USD 2.4/100 doses). However, developing countries such as India cannot afford to extend the current control strategies and continue to observe incidences of PPR. Hence, a strong mass vaccination programme that does not exclude a single susceptible animal from vaccination for a considerable period is necessary. Furthermore, the migration routes, trade routes, state borders, and high-risk regions within the states need to be covered during vaccination drives to eradicate the disease. Furthermore, the syndromic surveillance and attending the outbreaks on time, as well as stamping out policy, if needed with compensation to farmers need to be implemented in the final stage of the eradication process.']}]\n",

Although similar clinical performances were noted in these patients, the individual associated soft and bony structural changes may differ, and the results could be altered using different modalities. Currently, various treatment options are available for canine OA, including surgery, rehabilitation, regeneration therapy, and nutritional supplementation. Detailed knowledge from these imaging modalities is essential for developing customized treatment for OA.', 'Our results indicated that osteophytes/enthesophytes could form in almost all anatomical compartments of the stifle joint in chronic OA, except for the tibial tuberosity. This is considered an acceptable result, since the tibial tuberosity is an extra-articular structure and may not be involved in the OA process. In addition, the osteophytes/enthesophytes at the femoral epicondyle (ME, LE), femoral condyle (MC, LC), and fabella (MT, LT) were the most evident and could be identified by all modalities. CT and MRI may be more sensitive than DR at femoral trochlear ridges (FT) because the superimposition of osteophytes, enthesophytes, and distal femur can be avoided.', 'In the fabella subregions (MF and LF), it may be difficult to identify osteophytes and enthesophytes by using DR and MRI. Severe osteophytes in the distal femur may superimpose on the fabella in the CdCr view, and bilateral fabellae may superimpose on each other in the lateral view. Moreover, multiple connective tissues may superimpose on each other at this site, such as the femoropatellar ligament and the origin of the gastrocnemius on DR images. These connective tissues also present hypointense signals on MRI; thus, they can sometimes be confounded by osteophytes and enthesophytes. In contrast, CT has the following advantages: multiple plane images; imaging processing by three-dimensional CT rendering and reconstruction; and the superior ability in differentiating the soft and bony tissues, allowing better identification of the osteophytes and enthesophytes better than the other modalities at the fabella site.', 'In the patellar region (DP, PP), MRI provided the highest sensitivity in detecting osteophytes and enthesophytes.

CT provides the most delicate bony structure lesion information with a moderate examination time. However, articular soft tissue lesions cannot be obtained without invasive techniques (e.g., contrast arthrography), and a higher cost than DR is required. MRI provides images of the superior ligament, meniscus, cartilage, and synovial effusion with adequate bony structure information.

      "[{'title': '1. Introduction: COVID-19 as a Chance to Rethink Teaching Formats', 'content': ['The pandemic presented numerous disruptions in many areas of life, including university teaching. Right from the start, university teaching around the world underwent severe restrictions, which led to a collective conversion from on-site events to digital formats. Despite the challenges this presented for teachers and students, it opened up opportunities to set up and explore digital teaching formats like never before. This paper presents a case study of an introductory animal ethics course that was significantly improved by reconstructing it in a digital format with flipped-classroom methods.', 'The course in question, offered at the Institute of Philosophy at the University of Vienna, includes a lecture and reading components. It is taught annually and forms a part of the curriculum for philosophy students in the BA and MA Philosophy programs, as well as for students working through a philosophical extension curriculum. Thus, it is credited in many different modules, but it is not mandatory in any module. It is evaluated with 5 ECTS credit points in the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System, in which 1 ECTS credit point is equal to 25 working hours. Thus, the course involves 125 working hours in total and is taught in German. As a lecture course, it does not require attendance throughout the semester, as there is only a written exam at the end of the semester for evaluation and three additional exams that take place throughout the following semester. The content is divided into two parts, the first one dealing with traditional theoretical approaches in the animal ethics debate and their critique, i.e., Peter Singer [', 'After the first semester was spent merely switching a pre-pandemic lecture format to the virtual classroom, there was room for improvement. Multiple incidents of plagiarism in the final exam challenged the examination format. Transferring the exam from an on-site mode to an open-book, online mode jeopardized any effective control over whether or not the learning objectives were actually met. The exams revealed that it was no longer apparent whether students could reproduce and apply their actual knowledge or whether they were just skilled in sharing and rewriting existing texts. This presented not just an immediate need for change but an opportunity to rethink established teaching methods and structure the course’s contents in a novel set-up, asking anew: which elements define good quality lecture formats, safeguard the learning objectives and can be transferred to an online setting? In answering these questions, the authors identified a list of five criteria that helped guide the design for this new lecturing format. Unfortunately, at the time of the redesign of this format, i.e., in the first months of the pandemic, the transition from ethics courses to online teaching had not yet been adequately addressed in the literature. Therefore, the authors have drawn on their own teaching experience and exchange with students to determine these criteria. The final list of five criteria has been separated into three criteria that qualify a good lecture from the students’ perspective and two criteria that any viable format should meet from a teacher’s perspective.', 'From a student’s perspective, what makes a lecture format worthwhile is, firstly, that the course should be tailored to the diverse needs of students. As the course in question is an elective and a lecture format does not demand mandatory attendance throughout the semester, the format should enable the students to decide when and how much they invest in the provided program. On the one hand, it should provide possibilities for increased engagement for students who are willing to dedicate more of their time. On the other hand, if students have only limited time resources, the materials provided should enable them to prepare independently and time efficiently for the exam. Secondly, a good lecture format should safeguard a high level of interaction between students and the teacher and allow for in-depth discussions. For those students who attend weekly sessions, there should be sufficient room for questions and discussion points. In order to safeguard this interaction, the format should further offer systematized opportunities for students to report on their experience with the literature so that the teacher can tailor the weekly input according to the students’ needs. Lastly, the exam should be designed in a transparent way that challenges students without causing unnecessary stress. Safeguarding transparency here allows students to prepare for the exam in a target-oriented way and to avoid any guesswork. The exam should position students to demonstrate what they understood, not what they memorized. ', 'The following two requirements for a good teaching format are from the teacher’s perspective. First, and most important, is that the new format must not permanently increase the teaching workload. This is a precondition to the requirements above, since many ways to meet student needs demand too much work from the teaching staff and are thus unlikely to be implemented. For example, giving individual feedback to voluntary weekly text submissions promises to be very helpful for students. However, correcting more than 20 submissions per week can easily add up to another full working day for teaching staff and, therefore, conflicts with other commitments. The more time-intensive any format is for the teacher, the less sustainable its implementation. Second, a good lecture format should provide sufficient flexibility for the teaching staff. It must be easily adjustable to online or on-site modes of teaching without compromising quality. ', 'In the following case, the course was designed expecting 40 to 60 students to attend the lectures and participate in the first examination at the end of the semester. Approximately 80 to 100 students were expected for the following three examinations that would take place throughout the next semester, thereby raising the total number of expected students from 120 to 160. The redesign, implementation and evaluation processes were carried out by a team consisting of one professor and an assistant.

While in a usual lecturing format, the arguments and central concepts of the literature are presented in the lecture by the teacher, in the ILLF, the students gain most of the relevant knowledge on their own by reading the selected literature. The activity that usually takes place outside of the lecture, i.e., developing understanding by putting theory into a practical context, is transferred to the weekly sessions. These sessions are not used to repeat the arguments from the literature, but rather to exclusively apply theoretical knowledge, providing opportunities to ask questions and have in-depth discussions. Therefore, attending the lecture is not beneficial for students who have not read the corresponding texts for the session. The central, flipped-classroom inspired, didactic element is a questionnaire containing a comprehensive list of semi-closed questions that guide readers through each of the texts provided in anticipation of the live discussion (see ', 'The new format begins with an online introductory session that presents an overview of the topics and explains the new format to the students in detail. It includes instructions on how to use the material and the online learning platform (Moodle). Furthermore, it points to interactive tools, such as the discussion forum for students, and a tool that enables students to give feedback anonymously at any time. A detailed breakdown of the credit points into working hours made the requirements for the seminar as transparent as possible. It would take approximately 18 h (12 sessions of 1.5 h) of attendance or listening to the recordings of the sessions, 66 h for reading (11 weekly sessions of 6-h literature preparation), 22 additional hours to fill out the questionnaire (two hours per literature/session) and, lastly, 19 h for final exam preparations.

Conclusions', 'content': ['This case study presented the implementation of an online teaching format that was developed by the authors as a reaction to the pandemic restrictions on university teaching. Taking this setting as the opportunity to explore digital formats, the authors drew from flipped-classroom methodology to design a novel lecture format, the Interactive Literature Lecturing Format (ILLF). The ILLF has been presented here as a structured didactic tool that introduces a novel format to recurring lecture courses with reasonable effort. It not only displays a high quality of the students’ engagement with animal ethics due to the independent knowledge transfer and the consequently engaging discussions, but it is also viable and enjoyable for the teaching staff. The evaluation survey further shows that the students’ satisfaction was very high throughout all phases of the lecture course, regardless of whether they were actively participating or whether they prepared independently for the exam. The ILLF restructures the lecture in a way that enables the teaching staff to reimplement it each semester without any alterations or compromises in the quality of teaching, as the high level of interaction with students is embedded within the structure of the ILLF. Thus, it is promising not only to remain with the ILLF for the animal ethics lecture discussed here, but to explore its further potential in other teaching areas, in other fields and in on-site teaching. However, when it comes to online-teaching, this case study has shown that it should not be regarded as a deficient or second-choice option per se. The implementation of the ILLF in an online mode shows that there are lecturing formats that can ensure high-quality teaching online. Thus, online teaching should be regarded independently from on-site teaching, as a didactic mode in its own right, that can obtain very good outcomes for both students and teachers, if the format actually fits the setting. Therefore, teachers should be encouraged to explore novel digital formats beyond any pandemic restrictions. ']}]\n",

The menace response and dazzle reflex were normal on the left eye. Apart from being geriatric, the cat had no other comorbidities in her clinical history. Her preoperative clinical examination was normal without any nystagmus noticed or reported during her ophthalmological examination, and her biochemistry and haematological results were unremarkable. The cat’s current medications included meloxicam and chloramphenicol ointment. For preanaesthetic medication, a combination of methadone (0.2 mg/kg) (Methadyne, Jurox, Leatherhead, UK), midazolam (0.3 mg/kg) (Hameln pharma Ltd., Gloucester, UK), and alfaxalone (1.5 mg/kg) (Alfaxan/Multidose, Jurox, Dublin, Ireland) was mixed in the same syringe and administered intramuscularly (IM). Anaesthesia was induced with a total of 1.8 mg/kg of alfaxalone administered through a right cephalic intravenous cannula. Intravenous fluid therapy was administered during anaesthesia at a rate of 3 mL/kg/h (Hartmann’s solution; Aquapharm No. 11; Animalcare LTD; York, UK).

After a minute of apnoea, manual ventilation was initiated. At the same time, there was an immediate rise in the cat’s heart rate (HR) from 102 to 140 bpm with a sinus rhythm. Unfortunately, there is no record of the concurrent blood pressure (BP), but we recall that it increased in parallel with the heart rate. Twenty minutes later, the cat was transferred to the operating theatre, and continuous mechanical ventilation (CMV) on a volume control mode was initiated using a veterinary ventilator (Merlin, Vetronic Services LTD, Devon, UK). During this time, no parameters were recorded on the monitoring sheet as the anaesthetist was involved in providing manual ventilation, but when the cat was moved to theatre, the blood pressure could not be measured with oscillometry or the flow Doppler technique. By that time, it was suspected that the administration of the local anaesthetic (LA) in the retrobulbar space could have been responsible for the occurrence of apnοea and the instability of the HR and BP. When the surgery started, the mean BP (MBP) was 50 mmHg, and the HR was 75 bpm. A dose of 0.01 mg/kg of glycopyronium (Accord Healthcare Limited, Durham, UK) was administered intravenously (IV) and was repeated after 5 min as there was no effect. Due to the lack of response to the anticholinergic, a dose of 0.1 mg/kg of ephedrine (MaCarthys Laboratories, Martindale Pharma, Brentwood, UK) was administered IV, and this was repeated again after 10 min, after which the MBP increased to 80 mmHg but only temporarily.

Although an US-guided technique was used and negative pressure was applied before the injection, this complication could not be avoided, and we highlight the importance of using colour-flow Doppler for better visualisation of the vasculature.

However, the study has strengths: a population-based longitudinal study sample was used, with frequent follow-ups; however, hospitalized or institutionalized elderly were not included in the study. Even working with the elderly and the study not being initially planned to have a cohort design, the follow-up rate was high.', \"Social and economic determinants were found to influence on the elderly's need for help to use their medications, and a high prevalence of elderly people on continuous treatment (with a quarter of these forgetting to take doses eventually, significantly higher among those who need help).

      "['The three objectives of this exploratory study were to (1) directly compare dog and cat owners’ beliefs about the number of emotions their pets could express, (2) evaluate what behavioral changes were associated with each emotional expression by owners, and (3) analyze the influence of various owner and pet-related factors on the owners’ belief. Regarding the 1st objective, our analysis revealed that pet owners only reported more anger in cats than in dogs and a more frequent expression of two other primary and eight secondary emotions in dogs (', 'Nonetheless, domestication history may also be important. Dogs were historically selected to work for humans, in roles typically requiring frequent heterospecific communication and understanding [', 'The fact that cats are semi-solitary animals may also explain why anger was the only emotion reported significantly more frequently in cats than in dogs by cat-only owners. For instance, aggressive behavior may be more common in cat-only households with multiple cats competing for key resources and territorial boundaries [', 'Regarding the second objective, our analysis revealed that both dog and cat owners tended to rely on a comparable set of sources of behavioral cues, especially body posture, facial expression, and head posture, to detect their pet’s emotions, indicating the important role of nonfacial cues in identifying animal emotions. As the facial expression is generally the dominant channel of emotional expression in human–human emotional perception [', 'The pet (especially dog) owners further believed that many different categories of animal emotions were associated with distinctive combinations of behavioral cues, such as changes in facial expression and body posture for dog embarrassment, and changes in proximity to the owner and physical contact for dog empathy (', 'Regarding the third objective, our analysis revealed that the number of reported dog emotions had a tendency to increase with owners’ increasing personal experience with dogs, but decrease with increasing professional experience with dogs. As reading a dog’s body language and multimodal emotional behavior is likely to involve a social learning process, longer dog ownership may allow the owners to pick up on subtle changes in their dog’s behavior and to be familiar with (or sensitive to) different emotional triggers and contexts. This might enable them to report more (especially complex secondary) dog emotions. It could also be argued that this longer dog ownership would result in a stronger emotional bond between owner and dog with a concomitant increased risk of anthropomorphism and humanization bias toward their dogs [', 'Furthermore, the number of reported cat emotions was reduced significantly if cat owners also had a dog at home (the results for dogs were similar regardless of any cats in the house). One interpretation is that cats may behave differently (e.g., being repressed and less expressive) if they live with dogs compared to if they live alone or with other cats. Owners may also report fewer cat emotions if they spend less time with the cat because the dog is always close by. However, it is worth mentioning that most dogs and cats can share a house peacefully, and tend to choose to spend time in the same room every day [', 'It should be noted that the generalization of these reported research findings might be constrained by the limits of our sample population. For instance, the participating pet owners were dominated by female (87%) and Caucasian (90%) participants, as is common in such work. Given that the owners’ gender and cultural background may affect their ability to perceive dog emotions [', 'Nevertheless, the variation in the number of emotions reported between species has several implications, both for animal welfare and human health and safety. One potential implication is that the emotional states of cats, particularly those living with dogs, are being overlooked or interpreted incorrectly. This could mean that the welfare needs of cats are not being met in terms of reducing the incidences of negative emotions (sadness, frustration, boredom, etc.) and increasing the opportunities to elicit positive emotions (happiness, amusement, etc.). If the findings are driven by owners having a relatively less positive belief in cats compared to dogs, this could also affect how they treat their cats (e.g., the misattribution of cat fear as anger may lead to the use of positive punishment, negatively impacting the cat’s welfare). Furthermore, being unable to interpret subtle cat behavioral cues may put an owner at risk. For example, petting-related aggression often occurs because owners miss those subtle cues indicating that the cat wants the owner to stop touching them [', 'Conversely, it is also possible that the emotional capabilities of dogs are being exaggerated and/or misinterpreted because of increased anthropomorphism and humanization trends in dog owners. Believing dogs are just another member of the family can lead to welfare issues. If owners do not appreciate how different dogs are, particularly concerning their communicative signals, they may interpret dog signals in a human-like way more frequently. For example, the reported sources of behavioral cues for detecting guilt/shame in dogs were ‘head posture’, ‘body posture’, and ‘eye contact’, with the most likely scenario being a dog that is holding its head low, contracting its body and avoiding eye contact. In fact, these behaviors are typically associated with a fearful, deferent, or submissive dog, and so scolding the dog when he exhibits these behaviors may exacerbate the dog’s fear/anxiety [']\n",
      "5. Conclusions\n",
      "['This online study compared owners’ perceptions of their dogs’ and cats’ emotional expressions. Overall, more emotions were reported in dogs compared to cats, both from owners that owned just one species and those that owned both. While dogs and cats used a comparable set of behavioral signs to express the same emotion, distinct combinations tended to be associated with specific emotions in both cats and dogs. Although owner beliefs and anthropomorphisms are problematic in many situations, they are helpful as a starting point for an objective definition of animal emotions. With current technology, it is difficult to confirm animal emotional states; however, validating or refuting these owner beliefs could be the next step in this direction. This should be a high-priority research area as it is evident that regardless of whether owners are underestimating the emotional abilities of cats or overestimating that of dogs (or perhaps both), there are potentially important consequences for both humans and the animals they hope to care for.']\n",

The HEV strain may be transmitted between farms via human and pig movement. Pigs are usually fed on the by-products of slaughterhouse-derived sheep’s internal organs. The pigs had no restrictions on their movement. Phylogenetic analysis of the ORF2 region revealed that the HEV genotypes in the infected pigs in the vicinity of Ulaanbaatar city are homologous to those in sheep. This could be because sheep co-graze near pig farms in the same area. In comparison with HEVs from sheep detected in Töv Province, phylogenetic analysis showed genetic similarity with PF121, PF101, and PF175 from pigs. The geographical distance between Bayanchandmani soum (the sheep sample area) and Songino Khairkhan district intersects with livestock movement and feed distribution. Therefore, it is quite possible that HEV of livestock origin between the same regions could be transmitted via various routes. Mongolian sheep and goats usually co-graze in pasturelands together with other livestock, including cattle. We assume that sheep are not HEV reservoirs but are spillover infected animals.

Because its content and bioavailability in plant feed fluctuate significantly, it is often added to premixes in the form of inorganic trace minerals (ITM), for example, oxides, carbonates, chlorides, and sulphates.

      "1. A Commentary on Feed Additives as Solutions to Cattle’s Climate Impact\n",
      "['Since 2006, when the much-quoted FAO report Livestock’s Long Shadow [', 'The fact that domesticated animals produced around the world (mainly cattle, pigs, and poultry) now outnumber wild mammals and birds by a factor of ten no doubt adds pressure to this predicament [', 'While the identification of some of the most problematic environmental impacts of cattle is seemingly more or less unanimous, solutions are complex and might even point in opposite directions. As is clear from this special issue, one set of solutions points to interventions into the causal relations of elements kinetically moving one another inside the cow’s rumen. More specifically, feed additives of various sorts are developed to decrease the generation of methane, thus targeting climate change. Surely, these interventions are valuable—after all, in these critical, increasingly hot times, why oppose GHG reductions in whatever form and by whatever means? Nonetheless, in this short contribution, we raise two concerns regarding a focus on solving emissions through feedstuff development. Whereas knowledge about the possibilities of technological optimization is important, we suggest that broader visions of the possible negative outcomes of further optimization are also needed. Notably, we are concerned for two reasons: First, the development of feed additives may overshadow discussions about downscaling. Second, a narrow focus on reducing enteric gasses by manipulating a set of kinetic causal processes inside the rumen may bracket other relations between cattle and landscapes. Both of these consequences, we suggest, can potentially limit the scope of climate impact mitigation in relation to cattle. Below, we substantiate these reservations and go on to probe how the development of feed additives sit with ideas about absolute sustainability and safe operating spaces for humanity. Our approach to the issue of feed additives and cattle production is rooted in anthropology and cultural history. We thus work using a method of ethnographic fieldwork among stakeholders engaged in Danish cattle production, and we conduct document analysis of, e.g., policies and public discussions, just as we look to archival and historical literature to trace earlier connections between state making and livestock production in Denmark.']\n",

      "['Within the agricultural sciences, an answer to the problematic climate impact of cattle has often been to further intensify animal production cf. [']\n",
      "3. The Issue of Scale and Re-Bound Effects\n",
      "['Indeed, to pinpoint our first reservation, focusing on greening the enteric digestion process by making ‘enhanced’ rumens less harmful, and politically prioritizing this effort, may engender a so-called rebound effect where decreased methane emission pr. cow is evened out by an increased scale of production—a mechanism sometimes summarized as Jevons’ paradox. In other words, addressing the issue of methane emission through conceptualizing the rumen as a discrete and singular site of intervention may occlude the concern both with a potential rise in scale and with other the well-known, environmentally harmful effects of maintaining present-scale livestock production [']\n",
      "4. The Issue of Other Ecological Relations\n",
      "['Our second hesitation is that a narrow focus on kinetics inside the rumen may eclipse wider ecological relations put into motion by the altered processes in the rumen. As the many ecological crises we are witnessing make clear, humans can no longer be seen as being in full control of various processes on earth—what we referred to above as the ‘feral’ nature of the non-human world in this day and age. Processes once perceived as controllable have proven not to be so, resulting in unintentional global effects that are both distributed and caused by human actions [']\n",
      "5. Thinking with Absolute Sustainability\n",
      "['To summarize, our hesitations with regard to feed additives concern, first, how additives may maintain status quo in terms of the scale of cattle production, and second, how they may engender unanticipated ecological effects. On both accounts, we suggest, there is a need to consider how technological and natural scientific solutions to the methane issue relate to a planet with boundaries that limit a safe operating space for humanity [', 'If, as we suggest, technological solutions ‘work back’ on the identification of what the problem even is, the result is too easily a circular argument; we can only see the problems that we think we can solve by way of technology—rather than by a just and green societal transition, sanctioned in progressive politics. In making this argument, and exploring how it works in a Danish context, we draw on the model of planetary boundaries originally suggested by Rockström et al. [']\n",
      "6. A Couple of Examples\n",
      "['To substantiate our argument, below we will look at a couple of instances where feed additives are discussed in a Danish context. We do so via ethnographic fieldwork, where we engage with stakeholders such as researchers and politicians, as well as with various written sources. Our method is ethnographic in the sense that we trace relations and generate analyses in dialogue with the field; as such, we explore what feed additives may be as they are produced and discussed by people who develop, implement, or entrust them with positive effects for mitigating climate change—see also [', 'What we want to point to here is that the means for a very large proportion of the CO', 'Another example from our fieldwork sheds light on the potential unintended effects of implementing feed additive solutions. Below, we provide more detail regarding some of the ways that feed additives work in the practices and discussions of industrial agriculture stakeholders. At the annual Cattle Congress 2022, the head of the Cattle Section in SEGES Innovation—the Danish agricultural interest organization’s independent research unit—together with a researcher from the same organization, gave a talk under the headline “Climate Requirements in the Agricultural Agreement”—the same deal mentioned above. From her point of view, climate requirements can be answered by two distinct means of action: the handling of digestion and manure—while not compromising another distinct theme, namely animal welfare. In this way, she framed the problems involved in having an agricultural sector accounting for over one fourth of Danish GHG emissions by setting a very particular triangular frame within which one should think, talk, research, and act in relation to climate requirements: welfare, digestion, and manure. ', 'She mentioned that feeding with additives could reduce 20% of the 0.17 million tons CO', 'What interests us here is that the talk can be seen as combining the launch of a solution with calling for further tests, thereby mimicking the agreement above in its expectations for future effects of something yet to be fully developed and tested. Interestingly, a person in the audience raised his hand and questioned the manure from cattle fed with the approved additive, asking whether the emissions from it altered when distributed on the fields. In response, the researcher answered that the amount of product used is so small, and further that the product is processed so quickly in the cow that it was very unlikely that it would have an effect elsewhere, outside the rumen. However, he continued, researchers in Canada have recently conducted a study where they pointed to higher emissions from manure in the fields as an effect of the application of feed additives. Interestingly, this Canadian study—or hesitation, we could call it—did not seem to ‘alter’ the Danish researcher’s hopes for feed additives once they have been further tested. Chatting with the researcher after the talk, it became clear that potentially increased emissions on the fields were understood as a problem for another research field—namely, that which deals with manure handling. For him, it seemed, there were so many kinetic relations to be explored within the rumen, and understanding what happens later, out on the fields, would be a theme to be researched once processes in the rumen are more fully understood. Our point here is to highlight the decoupling of what goes on in the rumen upon applying feed additives from the ‘afterlife’ of such an intervention. ']\n",
      "7. Conclusion: Heeding all Biosphere Domains at Once\n",
      "['To conclude, what we argue—and the reason for our reservations towards the prevalent kind of solutionism offered by the development of feed additives—is that it takes a very particular perspective on the cow for its rumen to be the sole target of any intervention. From this perspective, the cow is a singular unit from within which technology can decrease methane emission. To the contrary, as anthropologists, we would see any cow as a set of relations, ranging from the microbial level to global issues of deforestation [']\n",

This might be explained by the fact that mccRCC patients were previously found to have low ctDNA amounts in general [', 'Moreover, it is important to note that we found the methylation score to be significantly associated with the PFS, but not with the WW time. As per the protocol, some patients who progressed according to RECIST 1.1 did not start with systemic treatment directly, explaining the difference between the observed PFS and WW times. The main reasons not to start treatment were the progression of overall small sized metastatic lesions or lesions growth not leading to overt symptoms; the decision not to start treatment in these cases reflects the current daily practice. This raises the question of whether a biomarker that is better correlated with radiological progression than with WW time will ever be clinically relevant in this setting, even if it outperforms the IMDC score.']\n",

Although this study did not find definite proof that cfDNA methylation patterns are associated with WW time, this should be validated in larger studies, in which plasma should be collected prospectively.

Severity comprises two components: the intensity of the adverse state such as pain or distress and, secondly, its duration. Another factor to consider when calculating the overall animal welfare impact of an experiment is any cumulative suffering, for example, inadequate husbandry, in addition to the experimental procedures, the number of times an animal is subjected to a repeated technique (e.g., injections) or procedure or any additional procedures in more complex protocols. Short-term intense stressors may also have long-term impacts, e.g., on the immune system. It is possible to determine the overall animal ‘cost’ in terms of harms in a series of experiments by including the number of animals affected.', 'In competent humans, the assessment of suffering usually relies on verbal reporting of some sort, whereas in babies and other non-verbal or non-communicating humans and non-human animals, other methods have to be used. In animals, an estimate of the intensity of suffering can be made by measuring the impact of an experimental protocol on an animal, i.e., the degree to which it has deviated from normality compared with a control naïve group kept in a similar or the same way. The duration of any suffering is the second most important component of severity and is far easier to measure objectively, although it is often not specified. The combination of intensity and duration is used to estimate ‘severity’. The advantage of measuring impact by deviation from normal in this way is that it does not require the type of adverse state experienced to be explicit, that is, it does not need to be defined as pain, physical dystress (a state of stressor overstimulation of the endocrine system as first described by Moberg 1985) [', 'Considerable advances have been made in the details of these sorts of abnormalities and their observational robustness in many areas of research.

The second stage is to select the time at which to score those criteria. There is no limit to the number of criteria scored or the number of time points chosen, but in order to reduce workload, only the key and most relevant criteria should be used. These key criteria should also best reflect an animal’s adverse state and not simply repeat other closely correlated signs. In addition, the measured signs should reliably indicate severity, be robust, subject to little inter- or intraobserver variation, and be economical and easy to measure. Furthermore, the criteria measured should be independent of each other, for example, a failure to eat and body weight are usually closely interdependent.', 'The aim of this semiquantitative assessment is to be able to compare predicted and actual suffering and to express these estimates mathematically. In the following example, the deviation from normality or intensity is determined for each independent criterion for each animal in the group at a set time. This figure is then averaged to obtain a score for that criterion. The average score per animal is made up of the averages for each criterion. It is then possible to compare, for example, different experimental groups at the same time point, as well as at different time points in an experiment. The easiest way to understand this is to provide a simplified working example.', 'In a study of drug safety and effectiveness, several doses were given, and the rats were observed for adverse effects.

However, it must be noted that digits and numerals may not always have a number concept. For example, suppose that there are three classrooms at a school, such as classes 1, 2, and 3, or A, B, and C. The numerals in this example are not based on any cardinal or ordinal scale of numbers; instead, they are used on a nominal scale of numbers to distinguish three different things. The present study does not directly focus on numbers as it aimed to teach a sequence of Arabic numerals from 1 to 19. Therefore, this study is related to the existing literature on sequence learning and the sequential order of items [', 'Numbers have been studied in humans and nonhuman animals [', 'The concept of numbers has been studied from an evolutionary perspective as well.

Third, there have been no studies teaching the use of decimals to systematically increase the repertoire of using numerals beyond 9.', 'What kind of numerosity judgment is used by animals: subitizing, counting, or magnitude estimation? This is not clear, because the numerical repertoire of the animals is still small, with a few exceptions [', 'Numbers can be described in various ways.

The decimal number is a structuralized notation system: there is a “spiral staircase” or a “clockwise” structure. Each stair of the single-digit numerals goes up and round to the next stair of two-digit numerals from 10 to 19, to further stairs from 20 to 29, from 30 to 39, and so on.

They had previous experience of touching the numerals 1 to 9 in ascending order. Then, the decimal number system was introduced and the chimpanzees learned to touch the numerals 1 to 19. The sequential touching was taught in two different conditions. One was to touch from 1 to the numeral X (Startfix condition). The other was to touch from the numeral X to 19 (Endfix condition). Daily baseline training was based on the two conditions of adjacent numerals. A systematic test examined the following four factors: range (1 to 9 vs. 1 to 19), adjacency (adjacent vs. nonadjacent), number of numerals (three, four, or five numerals), and memory (nonmemory task vs. memory task). All four factors were important. The narrow range (1 to 9) was easier than the wide range (1 to 19). Adjacent numerals were easier than nonadjacent numerals for expressing the ascending order. As the number of numerals increased, performance decreased. Memory tasks caused deterioration of performance. The further examination focused on processing the numeral 10. Performance was relatively low when the numeral 10 was involved. Taken together, with some difficulties, chimpanzees can master the sequence order in the range 1 to 19 in the two-digit Arabic numerals.', 'Direct comparison was carried out between humans and chimpanzees using the same apparatus and the same procedure. It was revealed that both humans and chimpanzees have relative difficulty processing two-digit numerals compared to one-digit numerals. The results were discussed in the framework of the global–local problem in information processing. Humans are good at processing multilevel information, including dual global and local levels. In contrast, chimpanzees tend to focus on local features and make quick decisions, much faster than humans.

      "['The results of this study suggest that the red deer adversely reacted to the disturbance by tourists to different degrees depending on the day of the week. Animals showed greater sensitivity to disturbances when many tourists were present; the higher number of alarm reactions and the higher alarm intensity observed indicated higher discomfort. We observed that the days with more tourist arrivals (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) led to higher alarm rates of animals, presenting a higher number of alarm reactions, as highlighted by the GLM results. During these days, the stimuli presented inside the enclosure induced a more intense response than during the other days, suggesting that the animals were disturbed to the point of changing their current state (changing attitude or fleeing) than on every other day. This is visible in the RDA graphs, where “Friday:inside”, “Sunday:inside” and “Saturday:inside” are positively related to the two highest intensity levels (2 and 3). However, as the GLM indicates, the highest number of alarm reactions was seen on Monday; this suggests that stressors’ effects build up during the weekend, leaving the deer particularly sensitive to disturbances, despite lower exposure to tourists. This is consistent with Sibbald et al. [', 'The disturbance effects’ accumulation may also explain the differences between the alarm reactions displayed before, during and after exposure to tourists. The animals were less sensitive to stimuli before tourists’ arrival and more sensitive during the tourists’ presence, with higher intensity during this particular condition. As shown in the GLM, the variable “during tourists’ presence” was significantly higher than previously seen and positively related to the alarm reaction intensity levels 2 and 3 in the RDA graph. Tourists induced a change in attitude in the deer, with possible negative effects on their welfare, derived from a change in time spent grazing, resting or nursing. The animals still appeared sensitive to the disturbance after the tourists had left, but with a lower intensity level (intensity level 1). ', 'The time of the day did not particularly affect the animals’ alarm reactions, but we observed a higher response on Monday morning. Stankowich’s study demonstrated that female deer and young animals appear to flee to greater distances than males [', 'The results suggest that the deer responded differently to different visual stimuli. They were less reactive to stationary movements; a person standing (S) alarmed the animals less and with a lower intensity, while the movements toward the animals (M) produced a significantly higher number of alarm reactions at a higher intensity level, with the variable “stimulus M” positively related to alarm intensity 2 and 3. It would be more energy-efficient for the animal to remain alert to the sight of a predator but only react strongly (i.e., run away) when the predator approaches, being an imminent threat to the animal [', 'It was observed that deer perceived the enclosure fence as a form of protection; in fact, the stimuli performed outside the enclosure alarmed the animals less than the ones performed inside, with a lower number of alarm reactions and a lower intensity level. The stimulus M performed inside the enclosure particularly alarmed the deer, as shown in the GLM results and in the RDA graph, with the interaction “M:Inside” being the most related to alarm intensity 3. This is consistent with Whittington and Chamove’s study [', 'The animals were observed displaying excretion alarm signals, such as urination before flight and defecating during it. In other studies, ungulates were observed displaying the same alarm behaviors—for example, in goitered gazelle (', 'We observed that the dominant male was particularly less sensitive to disturbances compared to the whole group of animals. However, as stated by Nemets et al. [', 'It is crucial to avoid stress during crucial periods, such as gestation, birth and nursing; for this reason, it would be advisable to avoid carrying out any activity inside the enclosure in such periods (in the study case, from May to mid-July). Mating season (in the study case, September to October) may be dangerous for humans inside the enclosure, due to the high aggressivity displayed by males. In this particular location, it is not possible to work during the winter due to the snow cover. Therefore, for this study case, the best time slots to perform activities inside the enclosure are March and April (if snow is not present) and August. August, despite being the more suitable one, is of interest to a great number of tourists. Consequently, it is important to establish the days/times that may be particularly suitable, avoiding the accumulation of disturbances (high tourist presence, humans inside the enclosure, etc.), which may increase the negative effects on the animals’ welfare.', 'Based on the results obtained from data elaboration, we can conclude that the best day to perform activities inside the enclosure is Wednesday, being the day on which the red deer showed alarm reactions at a lower intensity level. In addition, the alarm reaction number observed on Wednesday was the lowest of all the other days, and significantly lower compared to the reactions observed on Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday. However, Tuesday and Thursday could also be suitable days to carry out activities inside the enclosure, considering that the number of alarm reactions was significantly lower than the one observed on Monday. Conversely, the days on which to avoid carrying out activities that may stress the animals, inside the enclosure, are Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday. For this study case, taking into consideration the functional area distribution inside the enclosure, it would be recommended to concentrate the required mowing actions of different areas on different days, allowing the entrance of a few operators each day, in order to ensure that the animals have the possibility of hiding in a safe place. Some measures may be helpful in controlling disturbances by tourists and preventing direct contact with the animals, taking into consideration some tourists’ inappropriate behavior, such as touching the more confident individuals through the fence or feeding the animals inappropriate food (even if not allowed). Building a second fence at least 2–3 m away from the principal deer enclosure might help to provide more space between the humans and the animals. In the study case, additional observation platforms should be constructed and placed so that visitors can view the animals from a respectful distance.']\n",

      "['Many turfgrasses equine sports surfaces have different components than sand surfaces. However, in this experiment, the composition of the topsoil is closely related to a sand surface. The turfgrasses canopy adds another dimension to the interaction of the hoof–surface. The effect and the interaction of drainage and geotextile were tested with five devices. Previous studies on sand boxes were confirmed with the effect of drainage package and geotextile addition able to be detected with some of the simple instruments used in this experiment. In this study, TDR proved to be the most reliable tool, able to detect differences promoted by geotextile or drainage package despite the high moisture content. The effect of drainage on surface properties is likely to be related to the presence of both a vertical and horizontal water movement and the subsequent effect on packing particles that lead to higher VMC at higher water tension values and, in this sense, adding consistency. As in our previous study, the ability to test functional properties of the surface may be limited, however, due to the lower loads and lower load rates from these instruments. In addition, the turfgrasses canopy adds complexity through sward structure and variations in the height of mowing. These turfgrass properties contribute to the complex surface-hoof features and limit the ability to detect differences with simpler devices such as RPS, ITD, SCP, or GS. The different sensitivity of some tools like RPS, SPC, and GSI between dates highlights the interest in changes in the growth rate of shoots and roots and thickness of leaves regarding the season and affecting hoof-surface interaction. The lack of sensitivity of some devices may also be influenced by the method of turfgrass establishment. The turf was applied as sod, which included a 2 cm thick layer of silty clay soil which may be a barrier to the detection of drainage and geotextile treatments by the RPS and ITD. While future research may include washing the sod, this is not typically done in most installations. Moisture also plays a role in the lack of sensitivity of some devices. However, since the arenas or racetracks are outdoors, some combination of factors like drainage package and high volumetric moisture content may lead to turf with an off condition. Understanding the consequences of injury risk is the primary objective of the use of these tools.', 'Future work should consider alternative approaches that are also suited for monitoring the proper maintenance of the turfgrass surfaces. Methods such as vertical cutting and aeration are critical to ensuring that a high-quality surface can be provided that results in a consistent performance over time.']\n",

Many years of breeding have resulted in breeds that have been genetically combined and used for meat and milk production. Polish Merino has a close and dense fleece. Additionally, Polish Merino sheep mature early and show an aseasonality in reproduction. Because of these characteristics, the Polish Merino is Poland’s most common commercial breed.

      "['Modern animal husbandry relies on artificial insemination (AI) as a substitute for natural mating in some species, such as dairy cattle.

The most recently advocated one is an increased rate of genetic improvement in intensive animal husbandry [', 'One aim of holding bulls in AICs (AI bulls) is sperm production. Housing bulls in AICs varies between and within countries, but their objectives are to minimize the spreading of sexually transmitted diseases and to maximize the reproductive efficiency of the animals. Thus, a large number of males of different ages are kept in relatively static conditions at an AIC, without access to females. ', 'Compromised welfare can manifest in several ways, depending on the severity of the stressor and its duration of action. For example, long-term impairment of animal welfare can have profound effects on the animal, such as sub-fertility, reduced life expectancy, impaired growth, body damage, disease, immunosuppression, adrenal activity, behavior anomalies, and self-narcotization [', 'The concept of AICs is based on keeping male animals isolated from animals of the opposite sex. Due to the fact that breeding bulls in AICs is different than in natural conditions and that the process of semen collection is not normal reproductive behavior, requiring close human–animal interaction, there are many critical points in the semen production process that can cause animals to express inappropriate behavior. On the other hand, inadequate space and insufficient nutrition can cause health problems that further decrease animal quality of life.

One is simply to assess how animal welfare is affected by management practices, and the second application is to develop and test practices that improve animal welfare. For example, in the “Welfare Quality” project, a large cooperative research program that developed standards for cattle, pigs, and chickens, the scoring systems rely heavily on animal-based measures such as body condition, lameness, lesions, and agonistic behavior (e.g., Welfare Quality, 2009). Such results contribute to a growing recognition that good animal welfare is a complex outcome of different factors including animal genetics, management, and environment. ', 'During the last 70 years, efforts in the bull semen industry have been made to maximize reproduction efficiencies to meet demands.

      "['The main aim of this review was to summarize the critical points in bull semen production where animal welfare could be compromised. Furthermore, we explained how insufficiently welfare-oriented production criteria lead to stress and, subsequently, decreased reproduction efficiency. ', 'Assessment of animal welfare can be challenging due to its complexity and multifactorial nature. Poor animal welfare can be easily missed due to a lack of knowledge of the species and insufficient evaluation. This can be avoided by using appropriate methods for animal welfare assessment. Two primary methods which can be used are (1) objective evaluation by scoring specific criteria and (2) use of subjective judgments and evaluation. There are differences in the scoring systems between different countries [', 'The development of systems to evaluate animal welfare was based on scientific interest as well as public concern about the raising conditions and treatment of animals. The first versions were developed for animals used in research, teaching, and testing (RTT). In subsequent years, questions were raised about other animals and their keeping conditions. Thereafter, hundreds of welfare assessment protocols were developed around the world; all differ from one another based not only on the animal species and production group but also on the place where the animals are kept at the time of evaluation. ', 'Since AI technology is mainly used in the dairy industry, dairy bulls are usually the cattle kept in AICs. Krueger A et al. [', 'Bulls kept in AICs are unique in many ways; they are mostly dairy breeds with specific metabolic requirements due to the intensive selection for milk production. Furthermore, husbandry conditions for AI bulls differ slightly between countries at present but have huge differences compared with other animals from the same species and between production groups (beef and dairy). In addition, semen collection is not a natural way of expressing reproduction behavior. All of these differences and specifics require detailed knowledge of AI bull physiology, behavior, and husbandry before defining criteria for welfare assessment. It might be possible to create a unique WAP for the specific conditions of AI bulls by analyzing different existing welfare assessment protocols and approaches to welfare assessment. ', 'Subjective evaluation is difficult to eliminate in total because of the observers´ projection of their own impression. This can be minimized by the personnel responsible for these assessments attending training programs and by establishing criteria that define good welfare customized to the species, sex, age of animals, and production purpose. The whole goal of assessment programs should focus on minimizing the subjective component. One objective assessment system, which has been developed during the past few decades, was Welfare Quality', 'The focus of all further assessment protocols should be the same, i.e., reducing stress in animals from the beginning but also promoting positive stimulants. The reason why this demand is important for the bull industry is that, apart from the known consequences of stress on reproductive parameters and performance, stress can also influence the onset of puberty [']\n",

      "['There is a lack of information on bull welfare assessment in AICs or on how disturbed welfare can be reflected in bull productivity. Production systems for breeding bulls should be described and evaluated to meet the standards of good animal welfare. More research is needed on welfare throughout an animal´s life, i.e., from when calves are selected to become breeding bulls to the end of the bulls’ productive lives. Furthermore, specific protocols for welfare quality evaluation for this specific production group of animals should be created, focusing on their physiological and behavioral needs, with the aim of achieving optimal productivity.']\n",

Our study found a positive regression relationship between the enclosing radius and MEA and sum inters and an inverse regression relationship with k. This suggests that as the distance of the terminal duct from the primary duct increases, the mammary gland will cover a larger area with more complex branching, while the terminal decay will be slower.

Interestingly, the regression coefficients of MEA, sum inters and k all showed greater absolute values when the nutritional restriction was 60% of the ad libitum intake.

However, there will be known endangered or range-restricted species that can be identified within a region or country that can have plans developed for them in advance in the case of a spill in their area. In general, eradication operations have significantly more time and ability to learn from both laboratory and field-based trials, including non-toxic bait trials, to determine species likely to be at risk, and to be able to trial the capture and holding of species prior to poisoning event, as seen for Gough and Lord Howe [', 'Conversely, since the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, oiled wildlife response has almost always been undertaken by professional and/or experienced wildlife veterinarians or rehabilitation centres, and has involved greater monitoring and documentation of events. Unfortunately for wildlife, due to the random, unexpected, and usually instantaneous nature of oil spills, and lack of planning, pre-emptive capture has not been undertaken frequently in oiled wildlife response. The speed at which the oil covers and impacts the environment and wildlife is often too fast to allow pre-emptive activities to occur; however, those that have occurred have been reasonably documented (i.e., [', 'For both oil spills and eradications, an essential lesson is understanding and using the knowledge learned from previous operations to improve current operations. These learnings can be everything from understanding species likely to be impacted, to how to manage and care for species, and for how long to keep them in captivity. However, this type of information needs to be written up and made publicly available from past responses for these lessons to be learned and used in the future.', 'All reports and articles on pre-emptive capture outline how logistically challenging it can be and, depending on preparation time prior to an oil spill or eradication poison application, pre-emptive capture can seem almost unfeasible. However, the case studies above outline how, with consideration and planning, particularly for planned eradication poison applications, pre-emptive capture or translocations can be successful and save significant proportions of populations or range-restricted species from potential extinction events. For an oil spill event, decisions for pre-emptive capture must be made in a time-critical window, meaning delays could result in wildlife being oiled or injured, or dying. Therefore, understanding the requirements as suggested below prior to a spill occurring, and therefore the activation of a predetermined wildlife plan and personnel immediately after an oil spill, is needed to ensure protective and preventive actions can be undertaken if the situation allows [', 'Primary requirements for pre-emptive captures include:']\n",

Using tumor volume data from untreated breast cancer patients, we fitted all of the patient trajectories to the logistic growth model and interpolated data at clinically relevant time points. Using these data, we were able to produce tumor growth dynamic curves and compare the use of three, four, five, and six measurements along the ground truth data. We added varying levels of noise to the interpolated data in order to capture a variety of possible patient scenarios.', 'Across growth rates and noise levels, we saw a trend where the median error decreases as the number of measurements increases. This is expected as having more measurements along the curve, especially further along the curve, provides more information into the dynamics of the logistic growth curve; however, the cost associated with having more measurements is time until treatment. This study aimed to provide the first insights into how many data points are necessary to estimate logistic growth parameters and predict tumor dynamics, dependent on uncertainty in clinically collected data and the clinician’s acceptable error in model prediction.', 'Across all of the noise levels, as the growth rate increases, the number of measurements necessary decreases. This could be due to the fact that at higher growth rates, the curves reach their carrying capacity in less time than at slower growth rates, and, thus, are able to capture more of the patient’s tumor dynamics in less time. At varying noise levels, we also found that as the noise level increased, the number of necessary measurements also increased to balance out the uncertainty in the data collected.', 'This is the first study, to our knowledge, that uses untreated patient-specific data to investigate when sufficient data have been collected to determine growth dynamics. Studies conducted in the past 10 years have primarily focused on predicting patient-specific responses to treatment to determine when and how to treat patients more effectively. While this is important, understanding untreated growth dynamics provides important information about the patient’s system unperturbed by treatment that oncologists might use to determine when to begin treatment or how best to administer it.', 'The presented study has focused on the logistic growth model and its two parameters, the growth rate and carrying capacity. If using an alternative model to predict tumor growth, for example, Gompertzian growth, the number of measurements necessary may vary, based on the parameters and dynamics of the model. When comparing models, determining the minimum number of measurements needed by each model for each distinct cancer type and patient cohort is likely a function of the specific model chosen, and the number of parameters being estimated. This will be explored in a future study.', 'It is also worth noting that tumor volume alone may not be fully indicative of a breast cancer patient’s condition. Additional prognosis factors such as the proliferation marker Ki67 or overexpression of HER2, as well as the mutational capacity of the tumor, might be useful in determining patient-specific carrying capacities.

      "['The socio-economic profile of the sampled farmers revealed that the majority of them were illiterate and small farmers (with landholdings < 2.0 ha) and their annual income was <1500 USD. An outbreak of disease in flocks affects the animal asset pattern, as well as financial and social security, and pushes these farmers to transitional poverty. Hence, to ensure the livelihoods of these farmers, it is important to control and prevent the incidence of PPR in their flocks. Karnataka state reported 150 to 200 outbreaks per year during 2004 to 2006 [', 'Though there were fewer reported outbreaks in Karnataka in recent years, the two primary surveys conducted here, covering 673 flocks, revealed incidences of 9.8% (survey I) and 4.8% (survey II), respectively. Similar results showing a higher incidence (17.5%) before mass vaccination (Singh et al., 2014) and a lower incidence (0.8%) after a mass vaccination campaign (MVC) were reported in Chhattisgarh state, India [', 'The observed variations in the estimated flock-level losses due to PPR in the surveyed years could be due to differences in the risk population, the number and severity of outbreaks, the age and sex compositions of the diseased flocks, the vaccination coverage in the preceding years, and the time and season of outbreaks. These findings are also in agreement with those of earlier reports [', 'The perception of the veterinarians regarding the PPR-CP’s rollout revealed that the majority of the veterinarians concurred with the various activities implemented in Karnataka state, viz., the control programme was planned well, the vaccination programme was accepted by the farmers, proper coordination existed between various functionaries of PPR-CP, and they agreed upon the effectiveness of extension services. Furthermore, regarding the performance of the functional components of the control programme, the majority of the veterinarians perceived that vaccines were available on time in sufficient quantities, they could vaccinate the targeted animals on time, storage and cold-chain facilities were available, and they could manage the outbreaks on time. Though the majority of veterinarians expressed positive opinions on the existing PPR control plan, including its rollout and the performance of the various functional components implemented in the state, a few of the veterinarians disagreed and some remained neutral towards the plan per se, as well as towards the level of coordination between the functionaries, the availability of funding, and the programme’s acceptance by farmers. The veterinarians’ opinions regarding the improvement of the existing control programme included imparting training on vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, increasing the provision of funds for various activities, and increased coordination with various authorities. This implies that there is scope for improvement in the existing programme. Furthermore, since India is planning to eradicate PPR by 2025–2026, all facets of the programme need to be revisited, revised, implemented, and monitored on a regular basis and, more importantly, the perspectives of the important ‘gatekeepers’ in the PPR eradication programme, such as field veterinarians, need to be included in the current programme. Although the availability of effective vaccines, diagnostic tests, veterinary infrastructure, and technical manpower were what prompted the government to initiate PPR control and eradication efforts in small ruminants in India [', 'Vaccination is an important palliative method to prevent infectious diseases [', 'At a broader level, the study provides evidence on the operational and financial feasibility of PPR-CP, as implemented in Karnataka state, India. However, the results of the present study need to be visualised with certain limitations, for instance, PPR was confirmed based on the clinical signs observed by farmers and triangulated with those of field veterinarians in the respective jurisdictions and was not based on laboratory confirmation; we also did not consider concomitant diseases; only major farm-level costs were considered in the financial assessments; and only 62 field veterinarians who responded to the survey were considered in the study.']\n",
      "5. Conclusions\n",
      "['Though Karnataka state followed a ‘focussed vaccination’ strategy after 2003–2004 and a ‘mass vaccination’ strategy after 2010–2011 under the PPR-CP plan, the disease continues to persist in the state. If the state and the country plan to eradicate PPR, the revisiting of the existing programme is warranted. Furthermore, strong facilitation measures are needed from the federal government for the effective implementation of the eradication programme in these states and to ensure effective coordination between the states. Despite long years of vaccination against PPR, the benefits outweigh the costs, mainly because of the low cost of the vaccine (USD 2.4/100 doses). However, developing countries such as India cannot afford to extend the current control strategies and continue to observe incidences of PPR. Hence, a strong mass vaccination programme that does not exclude a single susceptible animal from vaccination for a considerable period is necessary. Furthermore, the migration routes, trade routes, state borders, and high-risk regions within the states need to be covered during vaccination drives to eradicate the disease. Furthermore, the syndromic surveillance and attending the outbreaks on time, as well as stamping out policy, if needed with compensation to farmers need to be implemented in the final stage of the eradication process.']\n",

      "['This study recruited canine patients with naturally occurring chronic stifle OA with moderate lameness and evaluated DR, CT, and MRI imaging findings. Although similar clinical performances were noted in these patients, the individual associated soft and bony structural changes may differ, and the results could be altered using different modalities. Currently, various treatment options are available for canine OA, including surgery, rehabilitation, regeneration therapy, and nutritional supplementation. Detailed knowledge from these imaging modalities is essential for developing customized treatment for OA.', 'Our results indicated that osteophytes/enthesophytes could form in almost all anatomical compartments of the stifle joint in chronic OA, except for the tibial tuberosity. This is considered an acceptable result, since the tibial tuberosity is an extra-articular structure and may not be involved in the OA process. In addition, the osteophytes/enthesophytes at the femoral epicondyle (ME, LE), femoral condyle (MC, LC), and fabella (MT, LT) were the most evident and could be identified by all modalities. CT and MRI may be more sensitive than DR at femoral trochlear ridges (FT) because the superimposition of osteophytes, enthesophytes, and distal femur can be avoided.', 'In the fabella subregions (MF and LF), it may be difficult to identify osteophytes and enthesophytes by using DR and MRI. Severe osteophytes in the distal femur may superimpose on the fabella in the CdCr view, and bilateral fabellae may superimpose on each other in the lateral view. Moreover, multiple connective tissues may superimpose on each other at this site, such as the femoropatellar ligament and the origin of the gastrocnemius on DR images. These connective tissues also present hypointense signals on MRI; thus, they can sometimes be confounded by osteophytes and enthesophytes. In contrast, CT has the following advantages: multiple plane images; imaging processing by three-dimensional CT rendering and reconstruction; and the superior ability in differentiating the soft and bony tissues, allowing better identification of the osteophytes and enthesophytes better than the other modalities at the fabella site.', 'In the patellar region (DP, PP), MRI provided the highest sensitivity in detecting osteophytes and enthesophytes. The texture of osteophytes and enthesophytes at an early stage is similar to cartilage and appears radiolucent on DR or CT images, whereas the osteophytes and enthesophytes around the patella in the early stage may present hyperintense signals compared with cortical bone on MRI owing to incomplete mineralization [', 'It is challenging to evaluate ligament/tendon lesions using non-invasive imaging examinations, especially DR and CT. Nevertheless, MRI is useful for diagnosing ligamental/tendon lesions. In this study, various severities of ligament/tendon lesions were identified in the six ligaments and tendons around the stifle joints. CCL, CdCL, and LCL lesions were the major ligament lesions observed in all joints. CCL disease is the most common cause of hindlimb lameness in dogs, and progressive stifle OA will develop [', 'Synovial effusion at the IP subregion, which was strongly correlated with chronic OA, was found in all modalities. Consistent results have also been reported in experimental canine OA models and working dogs [', 'The subchondral lesion or bone marrow lesion may indicate inflammation, edema, and ischemic condition of the bone marrow [', 'Meniscal lesions were observed less commonly in this study. Previous studies revealed that the degenerative change and cranial cruciate ligament rupture could be associated with meniscal lesions [', 'Cartilage lesions are common and extensive in canine stifle OA. Although a previous study showed that MRI could evaluate the morphology of articular cartilage [', 'A recent study applied T2 relaxation time to determine changes in cartilage composition in normal beagles [', 'Our study had several limitations. The primary limitation is the lack of comparison between imaging findings with arthroscopy and histological examination because all cases were client-owned clinical cases. Another limitation of our study is its cross-sectional design with a small sample size of clinical OA cases, making it difficult to investigate the etiology of OA lesions. Further longitudinal studies including more dogs and patients with different severities of OA are warranted.']\n",
      "5. Conclusions\n",
      "['In conclusion, comparing the imaging modalities for canine stifle OA, DR provides adequate bony structure information, the shortest examination time, and the least budget consumption; however, most soft tissue and cartilage lesions could not be seen. In addition, the superimposition of abundant osteophytes and enthesophytes may have misled the results. CT provides the most delicate bony structure lesion information with a moderate examination time. However, articular soft tissue lesions cannot be obtained without invasive techniques (e.g., contrast arthrography), and a higher cost than DR is required. MRI provides images of the superior ligament, meniscus, cartilage, and synovial effusion with adequate bony structure information. Although the disadvantages of long anesthesia time during the examination and high cost are still of concern, MRI provides the most comprehensive joint images compared to other non-invasive imaging modalities used in this study, and these findings provide detailed information on stifle OA.']\n",

      "1. Introduction: COVID-19 as a Chance to Rethink Teaching Formats\n",
      "['The pandemic presented numerous disruptions in many areas of life, including university teaching. Right from the start, university teaching around the world underwent severe restrictions, which led to a collective conversion from on-site events to digital formats. Despite the challenges this presented for teachers and students, it opened up opportunities to set up and explore digital teaching formats like never before. This paper presents a case study of an introductory animal ethics course that was significantly improved by reconstructing it in a digital format with flipped-classroom methods.', 'The course in question, offered at the Institute of Philosophy at the University of Vienna, includes a lecture and reading components. It is taught annually and forms a part of the curriculum for philosophy students in the BA and MA Philosophy programs, as well as for students working through a philosophical extension curriculum. Thus, it is credited in many different modules, but it is not mandatory in any module. It is evaluated with 5 ECTS credit points in the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System, in which 1 ECTS credit point is equal to 25 working hours. Thus, the course involves 125 working hours in total and is taught in German. As a lecture course, it does not require attendance throughout the semester, as there is only a written exam at the end of the semester for evaluation and three additional exams that take place throughout the following semester. The content is divided into two parts, the first one dealing with traditional theoretical approaches in the animal ethics debate and their critique, i.e., Peter Singer [', 'After the first semester was spent merely switching a pre-pandemic lecture format to the virtual classroom, there was room for improvement. Multiple incidents of plagiarism in the final exam challenged the examination format. Transferring the exam from an on-site mode to an open-book, online mode jeopardized any effective control over whether or not the learning objectives were actually met. The exams revealed that it was no longer apparent whether students could reproduce and apply their actual knowledge or whether they were just skilled in sharing and rewriting existing texts. This presented not just an immediate need for change but an opportunity to rethink established teaching methods and structure the course’s contents in a novel set-up, asking anew: which elements define good quality lecture formats, safeguard the learning objectives and can be transferred to an online setting? In answering these questions, the authors identified a list of five criteria that helped guide the design for this new lecturing format. Unfortunately, at the time of the redesign of this format, i.e., in the first months of the pandemic, the transition from ethics courses to online teaching had not yet been adequately addressed in the literature. Therefore, the authors have drawn on their own teaching experience and exchange with students to determine these criteria. The final list of five criteria has been separated into three criteria that qualify a good lecture from the students’ perspective and two criteria that any viable format should meet from a teacher’s perspective.', 'From a student’s perspective, what makes a lecture format worthwhile is, firstly, that the course should be tailored to the diverse needs of students. As the course in question is an elective and a lecture format does not demand mandatory attendance throughout the semester, the format should enable the students to decide when and how much they invest in the provided program. On the one hand, it should provide possibilities for increased engagement for students who are willing to dedicate more of their time. On the other hand, if students have only limited time resources, the materials provided should enable them to prepare independently and time efficiently for the exam. Secondly, a good lecture format should safeguard a high level of interaction between students and the teacher and allow for in-depth discussions. For those students who attend weekly sessions, there should be sufficient room for questions and discussion points. In order to safeguard this interaction, the format should further offer systematized opportunities for students to report on their experience with the literature so that the teacher can tailor the weekly input according to the students’ needs. Lastly, the exam should be designed in a transparent way that challenges students without causing unnecessary stress. Safeguarding transparency here allows students to prepare for the exam in a target-oriented way and to avoid any guesswork. The exam should position students to demonstrate what they understood, not what they memorized. ', 'The following two requirements for a good teaching format are from the teacher’s perspective. First, and most important, is that the new format must not permanently increase the teaching workload. This is a precondition to the requirements above, since many ways to meet student needs demand too much work from the teaching staff and are thus unlikely to be implemented. For example, giving individual feedback to voluntary weekly text submissions promises to be very helpful for students. However, correcting more than 20 submissions per week can easily add up to another full working day for teaching staff and, therefore, conflicts with other commitments. The more time-intensive any format is for the teacher, the less sustainable its implementation. Second, a good lecture format should provide sufficient flexibility for the teaching staff. It must be easily adjustable to online or on-site modes of teaching without compromising quality. ', 'In the following case, the course was designed expecting 40 to 60 students to attend the lectures and participate in the first examination at the end of the semester. Approximately 80 to 100 students were expected for the following three examinations that would take place throughout the next semester, thereby raising the total number of expected students from 120 to 160. The redesign, implementation and evaluation processes were carried out by a team consisting of one professor and an assistant. This paper reviews the outcome of the redesigning process, the steps to implement it and the results of the systematically conducted students’ evaluation (']\n",
      "2. Design and Structure: The Interactive Literature Lecturing Format (ILLF)\n",
      "['The course design model that promised to meet all of the requirements is the Interactive Literature Lecturing Format (ILLF). In order to bring the criteria introduced above together in a feasible way, the ILLF draws from the flipped-classroom methodology: ', 'For an animal ethics lecture course, flipped-classroom methodology refrains from knowledge transfer consisting of one professor lecturing in front of the whole class throughout most of the lecture. While in a usual lecturing format, the arguments and central concepts of the literature are presented in the lecture by the teacher, in the ILLF, the students gain most of the relevant knowledge on their own by reading the selected literature. The activity that usually takes place outside of the lecture, i.e., developing understanding by putting theory into a practical context, is transferred to the weekly sessions. These sessions are not used to repeat the arguments from the literature, but rather to exclusively apply theoretical knowledge, providing opportunities to ask questions and have in-depth discussions. Therefore, attending the lecture is not beneficial for students who have not read the corresponding texts for the session. The central, flipped-classroom inspired, didactic element is a questionnaire containing a comprehensive list of semi-closed questions that guide readers through each of the texts provided in anticipation of the live discussion (see ', 'The new format begins with an online introductory session that presents an overview of the topics and explains the new format to the students in detail. It includes instructions on how to use the material and the online learning platform (Moodle). Furthermore, it points to interactive tools, such as the discussion forum for students, and a tool that enables students to give feedback anonymously at any time. A detailed breakdown of the credit points into working hours made the requirements for the seminar as transparent as possible. It would take approximately 18 h (12 sessions of 1.5 h) of attendance or listening to the recordings of the sessions, 66 h for reading (11 weekly sessions of 6-h literature preparation), 22 additional hours to fill out the questionnaire (two hours per literature/session) and, lastly, 19 h for final exam preparations. This comes to a total estimated workload of 125 h required for 5 ECTS.']\n",

      "['In order to gather a comprehensive view of the students’ perspective on the ILLF, an evaluation form was sent out to the students after each examination date. The exam is the element which eventually reveals how the flipped-classroom knowledge transfer worked for students overall, including those students who never participated in the weekly sessions. Thus, it is crucial to evaluate the students’ experiences not just throughout the semester but on the exam as well. That is why the evaluation targeted those students who were registered for an examination date after the corresponding exam. To gain targeted insights into the students’ perspective on the ILLF and its elements, evaluation forms were specifically designed via the established online survey tool, ']\n",

      "['This case study presented the implementation of an online teaching format that was developed by the authors as a reaction to the pandemic restrictions on university teaching. Taking this setting as the opportunity to explore digital formats, the authors drew from flipped-classroom methodology to design a novel lecture format, the Interactive Literature Lecturing Format (ILLF). The ILLF has been presented here as a structured didactic tool that introduces a novel format to recurring lecture courses with reasonable effort. It not only displays a high quality of the students’ engagement with animal ethics due to the independent knowledge transfer and the consequently engaging discussions, but it is also viable and enjoyable for the teaching staff. The evaluation survey further shows that the students’ satisfaction was very high throughout all phases of the lecture course, regardless of whether they were actively participating or whether they prepared independently for the exam. The ILLF restructures the lecture in a way that enables the teaching staff to reimplement it each semester without any alterations or compromises in the quality of teaching, as the high level of interaction with students is embedded within the structure of the ILLF. Thus, it is promising not only to remain with the ILLF for the animal ethics lecture discussed here, but to explore its further potential in other teaching areas, in other fields and in on-site teaching. However, when it comes to online-teaching, this case study has shown that it should not be regarded as a deficient or second-choice option per se. The implementation of the ILLF in an online mode shows that there are lecturing formats that can ensure high-quality teaching online. Thus, online teaching should be regarded independently from on-site teaching, as a didactic mode in its own right, that can obtain very good outcomes for both students and teachers, if the format actually fits the setting. Therefore, teachers should be encouraged to explore novel digital formats beyond any pandemic restrictions. ']\n",

      "['The nature of human–animal interactions is diverse. Animals have been an essential part of human lives for centuries, from being hunting partners to companion animals at home and livestock raised for human consumption at farms. Given this bond and inter-dependence, significance of attitude toward animals and other related influential factors is increasingly being recognized within the field of human–animal relationships as well as animal welfare [', 'Similarly, animals are an integral part of people’s lives in Pakistan. They serve various roles as pets, livestock, transportation and food animals, even being part of religious practices.

Absolutists believe that rules of morality should be followed even if there are rewards which can be attained by not following them. Subjectivists are of the view that there will be unpreventable negative consequences for ethical decisions given that every person follows their own different moral principles. For exceptionists, whether an action is morally accurate or not depends on the outcomes it produces [', 'This idealistic or relativistic view toward ethical actions affects people’s views and attitude toward animals and animal welfare [', 'These moralistic tendencies were further influenced by other factors such as age, gender, religion, pet ownership, and geographic location [', 'As China is economically prospering so their focus of attention was on attaining the latest technological advancements due to which their awareness regarding animal welfare was highly limited. People in such countries formed their views regarding animals based on the advantages they can derive from them instead of considering their wellbeing. Given that Pakistan is a developing country with significant cultural differences from developed countries, the way human demographics interacted with ethical ideologies in forming attitudes towards animals will also differ. The current study aimed at highlighting any cultural influence on ethical ideologies by comparing the outcomes with other published studies.']\n",

Molecular cytogenetics could be very useful for the study of those species which have not yet benefited from the genomic revolution, or which are still in its early stages: in this sense, the water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) is the main example. Despite possessing a great economic importance, its genome has been decrypted and made available only recently, and the application of other technologies is very late.

      "['In conclusion, we present a unique case of clear cell EOC with vertebral OM resulting in pathologic C1 fracture requiring surgical stabilization, further complicated by vertebral artery encasement and narrowing. OM secondary to OC are rare and often present with pain though rarely with neurologic deficit. The risk factors for the development of OM are poorly understood but may include clear cell EOC as in this case, and lesions are more commonly described in those with late-stage disease. Patients who present with OM at the time of diagnosis or early in their disease course may have shorter overall survival than those with later OM. However, survival after OM diagnosis is on the order of months. Surgery at the primary site and combination chemotherapy and RT may prolong survival. These findings are based on limited retrospective studies, and further examination of risk factors and prognostic implications of OM in OC is needed.']\n",

      "['A 13-year-old neutered, blue-eyed female Siamese cat with a bodyweight of 4.8 kg was scheduled for enucleation of the right eye due to panuveitis and secondary glaucoma. The menace response and dazzle reflex were normal on the left eye. Apart from being geriatric, the cat had no other comorbidities in her clinical history. Her preoperative clinical examination was normal without any nystagmus noticed or reported during her ophthalmological examination, and her biochemistry and haematological results were unremarkable. The cat’s current medications included meloxicam and chloramphenicol ointment. For preanaesthetic medication, a combination of methadone (0.2 mg/kg) (Methadyne, Jurox, Leatherhead, UK), midazolam (0.3 mg/kg) (Hameln pharma Ltd., Gloucester, UK), and alfaxalone (1.5 mg/kg) (Alfaxan/Multidose, Jurox, Dublin, Ireland) was mixed in the same syringe and administered intramuscularly (IM). Anaesthesia was induced with a total of 1.8 mg/kg of alfaxalone administered through a right cephalic intravenous cannula. Intravenous fluid therapy was administered during anaesthesia at a rate of 3 mL/kg/h (Hartmann’s solution; Aquapharm No. 11; Animalcare LTD; York, UK). Anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane (Sevohale, Chanelle, Galway, Ireland) in 100% oxygen administered through a Mapleson-D breathing system. Throughout anaesthesia, heart rate and rhythm with electrocardiography, haemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO', 'Immediately after the injection and before the needle had been removed, the cat became apnoeic. After a minute of apnoea, manual ventilation was initiated. At the same time, there was an immediate rise in the cat’s heart rate (HR) from 102 to 140 bpm with a sinus rhythm. Unfortunately, there is no record of the concurrent blood pressure (BP), but we recall that it increased in parallel with the heart rate. Twenty minutes later, the cat was transferred to the operating theatre, and continuous mechanical ventilation (CMV) on a volume control mode was initiated using a veterinary ventilator (Merlin, Vetronic Services LTD, Devon, UK). During this time, no parameters were recorded on the monitoring sheet as the anaesthetist was involved in providing manual ventilation, but when the cat was moved to theatre, the blood pressure could not be measured with oscillometry or the flow Doppler technique. By that time, it was suspected that the administration of the local anaesthetic (LA) in the retrobulbar space could have been responsible for the occurrence of apnοea and the instability of the HR and BP. When the surgery started, the mean BP (MBP) was 50 mmHg, and the HR was 75 bpm. A dose of 0.01 mg/kg of glycopyronium (Accord Healthcare Limited, Durham, UK) was administered intravenously (IV) and was repeated after 5 min as there was no effect. Due to the lack of response to the anticholinergic, a dose of 0.1 mg/kg of ephedrine (MaCarthys Laboratories, Martindale Pharma, Brentwood, UK) was administered IV, and this was repeated again after 10 min, after which the MBP increased to 80 mmHg but only temporarily. The HR remained at levels >100 bpm after the above interventions, while the MBP increased again only after a dopamine (Martindale Pharma, UK) IV infusion at a dose of 5 μg/kg/min was initiated.

[', 'Ultrasound-guided ophthalmic regional anaesthesia has been used recently in human ophthalmology, as it has the advantage of allowing visualisation of the retrobulbar structures and the needle at the same time as well as confirmation that the LA has been administered in the correct space. According to our knowledge, thus far, only extraconal deposition of the LA has been described in dog cadavers with US guidance [', 'In cats, an US-guided RBB with a trans-palpebral approach, as mentioned above, was effective in only 50% of the animals [', 'Advocates of the PBB highlight the reduced risk of complications, such as the distribution of the LA in the central nervous system (CNS), retrobulbar haemorrhage, and globe penetration, compared to the RBB, as the needle is inserted further away from these structures [', 'The technique routinely performed at our hospital is the US-guided RBB using a supra-temporal approach with intraconal deposition of the LA. This preference is due to the perceived greater success rates when an US-guided technique with an in-plane approach is used and the correct deposition of the LA can be visualised. Additionally, a smaller volume of LA is necessary, as it is injected inside the cone.', 'Humans receive regional ophthalmic blocks while awake, and the side effects vary from contralateral pupil dilation to amaurosis, convulsions, grand-mal seizures, hypertension/hypotension, tachycardia/bradycardia, and cardiopulmonary arrest [', 'In the case presented here, tachycardia, hypertension, and apnoea appeared instantly before the removal of the needle, and the cat remained mechanically ventilated until recovery. No obvious resistance was noticed during the injection, and the needle did not seem to have penetrated the optic nerve on the US image. Given the rapid onset of the clinical signs, CNS spread of the local anaesthetic exclusively through penetration of the sheath of the optic nerve is less likely. Unfortunately, there are no saved images to corroborate this, as it is not common practice to save images for every patient, especially in routine cases. Similar to our case and to the other case report from a cat, the first manifestations of CNS spread in humans are often hypertension and tachycardia. This can be explained as a parasympathetic blockade through a combined vagal and carotid sinus reflex block [', 'Following recovery from anaesthesia, the cat in the present case report had symptoms in the contralateral eye that could potentially be explained by brainstem exposure to the LA [', 'It is not clear why, upon administration of flumazenil, the cat started breathing spontaneously immediately, as midazolam causes minimal respiratory depression, and it did not compromise ventilation after administration in our case. However, when diazepam is administered with buprenorphine in rats, respiratory depression has been reported to be greater [', 'Lipid emulsion therapy has been proven to be effective for treating local-anaesthetic-induced systemic toxicity [']\n",

      "['We have presented a case report of a potential exposure of the CNS to ropivacaine after an US-guided RBB in a cat that showed sustained apnoea, cardiovascular instability, as well as nystagmus, mydriasis, and an absent PLR postoperatively in the contralateral eye. The early onset of symptoms, prior to needle withdrawal, indicates that an inadvertent intra-arterial injection of the LA was the possible cause, although we cannot exclude subarachnoid injection or a combination of the two. Although an US-guided technique was used and negative pressure was applied before the injection, this complication could not be avoided, and we highlight the importance of using colour-flow Doppler for better visualisation of the vasculature. Any medications that can be reversed could be beneficial for similar cases.']\n",

      "METHODS\n",
      "['Cross-sectional study with a cohort of elderly people, conducted in the urban area of the city of Pelotas, state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (approximately 340,000 inhabitants in 2016). According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE)', 'The sample recruitment and the first visit of the study called “COMO VAI?” (“How do you do?”) took place from January to August 2014. In total, 1,451 non-institutionalized elderly aged 60 years or older were included. The sampling process was carried out in two stages. Initially, clusters were selected using data from the 2010 Census', 'The second follow-up took place between November 2016 and April 2017, by telephone interviews; household visits were made in cases where telephone contact was not possible. Calls were made on different days and times, and participants not contacted by telephone had at least four visit attempts at the addresses made available to the study. The understanding of the questions was tested in a pilot study applied in face-to-face and telephone interviews.', 'Demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral characteristics were the independent variables selected based on studies assessing adherence to treatment', 'Behavioral and health variables were also considered, given their importance in the evaluation of health care for the elderly. Characteristics such as current smoking (yes, no) were evaluated, considering daily cigarette consumption for more than one month; and alcohol consumption (yes, no), considering consumption of at least one dose of alcoholic beverage in the last 30 days. In addition, the concept of “polypharmacy” was evaluated, that is, simultaneous use of four or more medications', 'Outcomes were obtained at the second follow-up with the following filter question: “Do you need help taking your meds at the right dose and time?” (yes/no), which indicated the need for help with medication.', 'Among those who needed help with their treatments, the three outcomes related to difficulties in taking medications were evaluated using the following questions: “Thinking about your medication, could you tell me if the following actions are ‘very difficult’, ‘a little difficult’ or if ‘not difficult’?', 'Continuous medication was also evaluated using the question “Do you take any continuous use medicine regularly, with no date to stop?” (Yes/No). For those who were on continuous medication, the following question was asked: a) “Do you sometimes forget to take your medicine?” (Yes/No); b) “How often do you have trouble remembering to take all your medications?”, with five response options: never/rarely, from time to time, sometimes, usually, always. Then, the responses were grouped into three categories (never/rarely, occasionally/sometimes, usually/always). These categories have been renamed to never, occasionally, and usually, respectively.', \"Only elderly people who met the outcome and were followed up at both moments were included in the analyses. The analytical sample maintained the characteristics of the original cohort, with the exception of age, since there was a significant decrease in the proportion of elderly aged 80 years or older (p=0.044) (Supplementary Table). Analyses were performed using the Stata statistical package, version 16.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, USA). First, the sample was described (followed up in 2016 and 2017). Afterwards, the prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) of the main outcome were obtained according to the characteristics of the sample. Poisson regression with forward selection was used to estimate the crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR), and the adjusted model included the variables that presented p<0.20 in the crude analysis to control for possible confounding factors. The respective 95%CI of each predictor's PR were estimated.\", \"Descriptive analyses of the frequencies of outcomes were performed. Proportions were compared using the Pearson's χ2 test.

      "DISCUSSION\n",
      "['This study shows that 15.5% of the elderly needed help to use their medication in the right dose and at the right time, and the greater the age, the lower the level of education and the worse the economic situation, the greater the proportion of elderly people who reported the need for help. Although there are methodological differences in studies that evaluate outcomes regarding the need for help and difficulty in using medications, in a population-based study carried out with elderly people aged 60 years or older in the city of São Paulo (SP), 8.5% of them had difficulty taking their medication and 89.3% received some sort of help in this task', 'The need for help with medications is a delicate issue, as when misused, they predispose the elderly population to the risks of polypharmacy and the possibility of developing more intense adverse or therapeutic effects, in addition to the likely increase in cost, both individually and for the health system', 'In addition, the need for help with medication can result in the need to expand the care network for the elderly and, in most cases, this network starts with family members, who leave aside their profession, leisure activities, and self-care to meet the needs of the elderly, often for prolonged periods, often until their deaths, which can lead to damage to the quality of life of the caregiver and the family', 'Another study, carried out in basic health units in the city of São Paulo (SP), used the Lawton Scale to identify the degree of dependence for IADL, and one of the evaluated items was whether the individual was able to take their medication in correct doses and in at correct times. It was observed that 46.8% of the elderly cannot, 28.2% need partial help, and only a quarter can use their medication without any help', 'Several factors are associated with impairment of functional capacity, such as advanced age, female gender, low income and education', 'The need for help from the elderly to deal with their treatments due to difficulty in handling medication packages, reading the packaging or taking too many medications directly interferes with adherence to treatment. Adherence to treatment is a complex, multifactorial matter that is essential for therapeutic results. When the patient does not adhere to treatment, there may be changes of various types, such as reduced benefits, increased risks, or both, which contributes to increased treatment costs for the elderly and for health services', 'The need for help to take the medication in this study can be explained, in part, by difficulties in activities of daily living identified in the first follow-up, which were also associated with older age, lower education, and presence of multimorbidities', 'Regarding the difficulties with the therapeutic regimen presented by the elderly who reported needing help, the greater difficulty was related to removing the medication from the package and reading it among elderly people aged 80 years or older. These difficulties may be associated with the loss of fine motor skills and reduced visual acuity in this population, although this study has not found a significant difference.', 'There is evidence that physiological aging can lead to decline in some tasks', 'Also, visual acuity can decrease with age and this can affect the ability of the elderly to read information on the medicine package, leading to errors or confusions, especially with those whose names are similar. A study carried out with 96 elderly people aged 65 and older from a community in the countryside of São Paulo showed a significant increase in the prevalence of low vision, compromising activities of daily living', 'Other important points refer to continuous medications, polypharmacy, and the self-perception of health. The elderly population lives with chronic health problems, being a great consumer of health services and medicines', 'However, the results of this study showed that, of those on continuous medication, about a quarter eventually forget to take their medication, although most of them reported never forgetting (74.9%; 95%CI 72.0– 77.5). These results were lower than those reported by Bezerra et al.', 'One of the limitations are the impossibility of collecting all behavioral and health characteristics in the same follow-up in which the outcome was collected, which may have underestimated or overestimated the relation of these variables with the outcome, even though the interval between follow-ups was of only two years. Not having evaluated the functional limitations of the elderly can also be a limitation, as these characteristics can directly influence the outcomes. However, the study has strengths: a population-based longitudinal study sample was used, with frequent follow-ups; however, hospitalized or institutionalized elderly were not included in the study. Even working with the elderly and the study not being initially planned to have a cohort design, the follow-up rate was high.', \"Social and economic determinants were found to influence on the elderly's need for help to use their medications, and a high prevalence of elderly people on continuous treatment (with a quarter of these forgetting to take doses eventually, significantly higher among those who need help). Studies that estimate the difficulties faced with medications by the elderly are important to support health policies and practices aimed at minimizing issues and guiding actions to improve adherence to treatment and rational use of medication.\"]\n",

Gestation in mammalians is a complex phenomenon and any physiological changes that occur during fetal development can affect the subsequent health and well-being into adulthood. Prenatal development is influenced by several factors, such as genetic background, size and age of the mother, size of the offspring, determination of the sex and function of the placenta. On the other hand, many pathological conditions or changes in homeostasis such as metabolic disorders, infectious events, stress and temperature could negatively affect the growth rate of embryonic or fetal development [', 'The first part of pregnancy is considered particularly sensitive because it concerns related physiological processes, such as the development of the corpus luteum (as a temporary endocrine reservoir), the implantation of the conceptus in the uterus, its growth, and the development of an efficient functional placenta [', 'Increased knowledge of the developmental processes during gestation could provide valuable information on potential alterations in embryonic/fetal development. Sheep have been largely used as an experimental model to study prenatal growth during gestation [', 'Ultrasonography is an advanced technique that provides greater quality images and is useful to identify and to study embryonic and fetal anatomical structures. The ultrasonographic assessment of skeletal growth represents an important marker to evaluate the correct development and health of the conceptus and to determine the gestational age [', 'Furthermore, sheep represents a useful and low-cost model to study dynamic fetal growth due to the possibility of finding fetuses of different gestational age from regularly slaughtered pregnant animals.

Ultrasonography is widely used in many domestic species to measure fetal development and to determine the gestational age [', 'As already described [', 'In the last years, various studies tried to investigate the dynamics of the development of the conceptus in mammals and in sheep, several studies focused on the skeletal development, since this species is considered an excellent model for human(s) [', 'Our study represents an innovative attempt to describe fetal skeleton development during the first part of gestation in sheep using ultrasonography associated with a differential staining technique that allows the observation of the first ossification processes.

Indeed, the conceptus must be fixed exclusively in ethanol and not in formalin, to avoid non-specific staining of embryonic structures. Furthermore, embryos with an age of less than 30 days cannot be processed due to the richness of glycosaminoglycans of the young connective tissue that interfere with the staining of the cartilage matrix.
